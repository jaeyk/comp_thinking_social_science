# Semi-structured data {#semi_structured_data}

```{r include=FALSE}
# To speed up building process 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

## Objectives

-   Automating the process of turning semi-structured data (input) into structured data (output)

## What is semi-structured data?

> Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not obey the tabular structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. Therefore, it is also known as self-describing structure. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-structured_data#:~:text=Semi%2Dstructured%20data%20is%20a,and%20fields%20within%20the%20data.)

-   Examples: `HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)` files (e.g., websites) and `JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)` files (e.g., tweets)

-   Why should we care semi-structured data?

    -   Because this is what the data frontier looks like: \# of unstructured data \> \# of semi-structured data \> \# of structured data
    -   There are easy and fast ways to turn semi-structured data into structured data (ideally in a tidy format) using R, Python, and command-line tools. See my own examples ([tidyethnicnews](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidyethnicnews) and [tidytweetjson](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidytweetjson)).

## Workflow

1.  Import/connect to a semi-structured file using `rvest,` `jsonlite,` `xml2,` `pdftools,` `tidyjson`, etc.

2.  Define target elements in the single file and extract them

-   [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package providers `parse_` functions that are useful for vector parsing.

-   [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) package for string manipulations (e.g., using regular expressions in a tidy way). Quite useful for parsing PDF files (see [this example](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-04-03-beer-and-pdftools-a-vignette/)).

-   [`rvest`](https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest) package for parsing HTML (R equivalent to `beautiful soup` in Python)

-   [`tidyjson`](https://github.com/sailthru/tidyjson) package for parsing JSON data

3.  Create a list of files (in this case URLs) to parse

4.  Write a parsing function

5.  Automate parsing process

## HTML/CSS: web scraping

## XML/JSON: social media scraping

### API

#### Objectives

-   Learning what kind of social media data are accessible through application programming interfaces (APIs)

**Review question**

In the previous session, we learned the difference between semi-structured data and structured data. Can anyone tell us the difference between them?

#### The big picture for digital data collection

1.  Input: semi-structured data

2.  Output: structured data

3.  Process:

    -   Getting **target data** from a remote server

        -   The target data is usually huge (\>10GB) by the traditional social science standard.

    -   Parsing the target data your laptop/database

        -   Laptop (sample-parse): Downsamle the large target data and parse it on your laptop. This is just one option to [deal with big data in R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2019/07/17/3-big-data-strategies-for-r/). It's a simple strategy as it doesn't require storing target data in your own database.

    -   Database (push-parse): Push the large target data to a database, then explore, select, and filter it. If you were interested in using this option, then check out my [SQL for R Users](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/sql-for-r-users) workshop.

![Sample-Parse. From RStudio.](https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2019-07-01-3-big-data-paradigms-for-r_files/sample_model.png)

![Push-Parse. From RStudio.](https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2019-07-01-3-big-data-paradigms-for-r_files/push_data.png)

-   But what exactly is this target data?

    -   When you scrape websites, you mostly deal with HTML (defines a structure of a website), CSS (its style), and JavaScript (its dynamic interactions).

    -   When you access social media data through API, you deal with either XML or JSON (major formats for storing and transporting data; they are light and flexible).

    -   XML and JSON have tree-like (nested; a root and branches) structures and keys and values (or elements and attributes).

    -   If HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are storefronts, then XML and JSON are warehouses.

#### Opportunities and challenges for parsing social media data

This explanation draws on Pablo Barbara's [LSE social media workshop slides](http://pablobarbera.com/social-media-workshop/social-media-slides.pdf).

**Basic information**

-   What is an API?: An interface (you can think of it as something akin to a restaurant menu. API parameters are menu items.)

    -   [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (Representational state transfer) API: static information (e.g., user profiles, list of followers and friends)

        -   R packages: [tweetscores](https://github.com/pablobarbera/twitter_ideology/tree/master/pkg/tweetscores), [twitteR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/twitteR.pdf), [rtweet](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet)

    -   [Streaming API](https://blog.axway.com/amplify/api-management/streaming-apis#:~:text=Streaming%20APIs%20are%20used%20to,a%20subset%20of%20Streaming%20APIS.): dynamic information (e..g, new tweets)

        -   This streaming data is filtered by (1) keywords, (2) location, and (3) sample (1% of the total tweets)
        -   R packages: [streamR](https://github.com/pablobarbera/streamR)

**Status**

-   Twitter API is still widely accessible ([v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access) recently released; new fields available such as [conversation threads](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id)).

> Twitter data is unique from data shared by most other social platforms because it reflects information that users *choose* to share publicly. Our API platform provides broad access to public Twitter data that users have chosen to share with the world. - Twitter Help Center

-   What does this policy mean? If Twitter users don't share the locations of their tweets (e.g., GPS), you can't collect them.

-   Facebook API access has become much constrained with [the exception of Social Science One](https://socialscience.one/blog/unprecedented-facebook-urls-dataset-now-available-research-through-social-science-one) since the 2016 U.S. election.

-   [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) access is somewhat limited (but you need to check as I'm not updated on this).

**Upside**

-   Legal and well-documented.

Web scraping (Wild Wild West) \<\> API (Big Gated Garden)

-   You have legal but limited access to (growing) big data that can be divided into text, image, and video and transformed into cross-sectional (geocodes), longitudinal (timestamps), and event historical data (hashtags). For more information, see Zachary C. Steinert-Threlkeld's [2020 APSA Short Course Generating Event Data From Social Media](https://github.com/ZacharyST/APSA2020_EventDataFromSocialMedia).

-   Social media data are also well-organized, managed, and curated data. It's easy to navigate because XML and JSON have keys and values. If you find keys, you will find observations you look for.

**Downside**

1.  Rate-limited.

2.  If you want to access to more and various data than those available, you need to pay for premium access.

#### Next steps

-   If you want to know how to sign up a new Twitter developer account and access Twitter API, then see Steinert-Threlkeld's [APSA workshop slides](https://github.com/ZacharyST/APSA2020_EventDataFromSocialMedia/blob/master/Presentation/02_AccessTwitter.pdf).

-   If you want to know about how to use `tweetscore` package, then see Pablo Barbara's R markdown file for [scraping data from Twitter's REST API](http://pablobarbera.com/social-media-workshop/code/02-twitter-REST-data-collection.html)

### Hydrating

#### Objectives

-   Learning how hydrating works
-   Learning how to use [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) to communicate with Twitter's API

**Review question**

What are the main two types of Twitter's API?

#### Hydrating: An Alternative Way to Collect Historical Twitter Data

-   You can collect Twitter data using Twitter's API or you can hydrate Tweet IDs collected by other researchers. This is a good resource to collect historical Twitter data.

-   [Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset for scientic use](http://www.panacealab.org/covid19/) by Panacealab

-   [Women's March Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/5ZVMOR) by Littman and Park

-   Harvard Dataverse has a number of dehydrated Tweet IDs that could be of interest to social scientists.

![Dehydrated Tweet IDs](https://github.com/jaeyk/digital_data_collection_workshop/raw/master/misc/dehydrated_tweets.png)

#### Twarc: one solution to (almost) all Twitter's API problems

-   Why Twarc?

    -   A command-line tool and Python library that works for almost every Twitter's API related problem.

    -   It's really well-documented, tested, and maintained.

        -   [Twarc documentation](https://scholarslab.github.io/learn-twarc/06-twarc-command-basics) covers basic commands.
        -   [Tward-cloud documentation](https://twarc-cloud.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/stable/pdf/) explains how to collect data from Twitter's API using Twarc running in [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS).

    -   Twarc was developed as part of the [Documenting the Now](https://www.docnow.io/) project which was funded by the Mellon Foundation.

![One ring that rules them all.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/8/8b/DOiAi2WUEAE3A1Y.0.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/699?cb=20200305221819)

-   There's no reason to be afraid of using a command-line tool and Python library, even though you primarily use R. It's easy to embed [Python code](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#python) and [shell scripts](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#shell-scripts) in R Markdown.

-   Even though you don't know how to write Python code or shell scripts, it's really useful to know how to integrate them in your R workflow.

-   I assume that you have already installed [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/).

```{bash eval = FALSE}
pip3 install twarc
```

##### Applications

The following examples are created by [the University of Virginia library](http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/toolkit/docs/social-media/twarc-commands/).

###### Search

-   Download pre-existing tweets (7-day window) matching certain conditions

-   In command-line, `>` = Create a file

-   I recommend running the following commands in the terminal because it's more stable than doing so in R Markdown.

![You can type commands in the Terminal in R Studio.](https://github.com/jaeyk/digital_data_collection_workshop/raw/master/misc/terminal.png)

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Key word 
twarc search blacklivesmatter > blm_tweets.jsonl
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Hashtag 
twarc search '#blacklivesmatter' > blm_tweets_hash.jsonl
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Hashtag + Language 
twarc search '#blacklivesmatter' --lang en > blm_tweets_hash.jsonl
```

-   It is really important to **save these tweets into a `jsonl` format;** `jsonl` extension refers to JSON **Lines** files. This structure is useful for splitting JSON data into smaller chunks, if it is too large.

###### Filter

-   Download tweets meeting certain conditions as they happen.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Key word
twarc filter blacklivesmatter > blm_tweets.jsonl
```

###### Sample

-   Use Twitter's random sample of recent tweets.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
twarc sample > tweets.jsonl 
```

###### Hydrate

-   Tweet IDs -\> Tweets

```{bash eval=FALSE}
twarc hydrate tweet_ids.txt > tweets.jsonl 
```

###### Dehydrate

-   Hydrate \<\> Dehydrate
-   Tweets -\> Tweet IDs

```{bash eval=FALSE}
twarc dehydrate tweets.jsonl > tweet_ids.txt
```

**Challenge**

1.  Collect tweets contain some key words of your choice using `twarc search` and save them as `tweets.jsonl`.

2.  Using `less` command in the terminal, inspect `twarc.log`.

3.  Using `less` command in the terminal, inspect `tweets.json`.

### Parsing JSON

```{r}
# Install packages 
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, # tidyverse pkgs including purrr
               furrr, # parallel processing 
               tictoc, # performance test  
               tcltk, # GUI for choosing a dir path 
               tidyjson) # tidying JSON files 

## Install the current development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("jaeyk/tidytweetjson",
                         dependencies = TRUE)

library(tidytweetjson)
```

#### Objectives

-   Learning chunk and pull strategy
-   Learning how `tidyjson` works
-   Learning how to apply `tidyjson` to tweets

#### Chunk and Pull

##### Problem

-   What if the size of the Twitter data you downloaded is too big (e.g., \>10GB) to do complex wrangling in R?

##### Solution

![Chunk and Pull. From Studio.](https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2019-07-01-3-big-data-paradigms-for-r_files/chunk_pull.png)

Step1: Split the large JSON file in small chunks.

```{bash eval = FALSE}
#Divide the JSON file by 100 lines (tweets)

# Linux and Windows (in Bash)
$ split -100 search.jsonl

# macOS
$ gsplit -100 search.jsonl
```

-   After that, you will see several files appeared in the directory. Each of these files should have 100 tweets or fewer. All of these file names **should start with "x", as in "xaa".**

Step 2: Apply the parsing function to each chunk and pull all of these chunks together.

```{r eval = FALSE}

# You need to choose a Tweet JSON file
filepath <- file.choose()

# Assign the parsed result to the `df` object
# 11.28 sec elapsed to parse 17,928 tweets 
tic()
df <- jsonl_to_df(filepath)
toc()

```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Setup 
n_cores <- availableCores() - 1

n_cores # This number depends on your computer spec.

plan(multiprocess, # multicore, if supported, otherwise multisession
     workers = n_cores) # the maximum number of workers

# You need to designate a directory path where you saved the list of JSON files.

# 9.385 sec elapsed to parse 17,928 tweets 

dirpath <- tcltk::tk_choose.dir()

tic()
df_all <- tidytweetjson::jsonl_to_df_all(dirpath)
toc()

```

##### tidyjson

The [`tidyjson`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyjson/vignettes/introduction-to-tidyjson.html) package helps to use tidyverse framework to JSON data.

-   toy example

```{r}

# JSON collection; nested structure + keys and values 
worldbank[1]

# Check out keys (objects)
worldbank %>% 
  as.tbl_json() %>%
  gather_object() %>%
  filter(document.id == 1)

```

```{r}
  
# Get the values associated with the keys 
worldbank %>% 
  as.tbl_json() %>% # Turn JSON into tbl_json object 
  enter_object("project_name") %>% # Enter the objects 
  append_values_string() %>% # Append the values 
  as_tibble() # To reduce the size of the file 

```

-   The following example draws on my [tidytweetjson](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidytweetjson) R package. The package applies `tidyjson` to Tweets.

###### Individual file

```{r}

jsonl_to_df <- function(file_path){

# Save file name 

file_name <- strsplit(x = file_path, 
                     split = "[/]") 

file_name <- file_name[[1]][length(file_name[[1]])]

# Import a Tweet JSON file

listed <- read_json(file_path, format = c("jsonl"))

# IDs of the tweets with country codes

ccodes <- listed %>%
  enter_object("place") %>%
  enter_object("country_code") %>%
  append_values_string() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename("country_code" = "string")

# IDs of the tweets with location

locations <- listed %>%
  enter_object("user") %>%
  enter_object("location") %>%
  append_values_string() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(location = "string")

# Extract other key elements from the JSON file

df <- listed %>%
  spread_values(
    id = jnumber("id"),
    created_at = jstring("created_at"),
    full_text = jstring("full_text"),
    retweet_count = jnumber("retweet_count"),
    favorite_count = jnumber("favorite_count"),
    user.followers_count = jnumber("user.followers_count"),
    user.friends_count = jnumber("user.friends_count")
  ) %>%
	  as_tibble

message(paste("Parsing", file_name, "done."))

# Full join
outcome <- full_join(ccodes, df) %>% full_join(locations)

# Or you can write this way: outcome <- reduce(list(df, ccodes, locations), full_join)

# Select
outcome %>% select(-c("document.id"))}

```

###### Many files

-   Set up parallel processing.

```{r}

n_cores <- availableCores() - 1

n_cores # This number depends on your computer spec.

plan(multiprocess, # multicore, if supported, otherwise multisession
     workers = n_cores) # the maximum number of workers

```

-   Parsing in parallel.

**Review**

There are at least three ways you can use function + `purrr::map()`.

```{r eval = FALSE}

squared <- function(x){
  x*2 
}

# Named function 
map(1:3, squared)

# Anonymous function 
map(1:3, function(x){ x *2 })

# Using formula; ~ = formula, .x = input 
map(1:3,~.x*2)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Create a list of file paths 
filename <- list.files(dir_path,
          pattern = '^x',
          full.names = TRUE)

df <- filename %>%

# Apply jsonl_to_df function to items on the list
future_map(~jsonl_to_df(.)) %>%

# Full join the list of dataframes
reduce(full_join,
       by = c("id",
              "location",
              "country_code",
              "created_at",
              "full_text",
              "retweet_count",
              "favorite_count",
              "user.followers_count",
              "user.friends_count"))

# Output
df
```
