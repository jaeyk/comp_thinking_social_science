## Using Bash (command line interface)

As William Shotts the author of *[The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)* put it: 

> graphical user interfaces make easy tasks easy, while command line interfaces make difficult tasks possible.

### Why bother using command line?

Create a plain text file that contains word "test"

- `echo`: "Write arguments to the standard output" This is equivalent as using a text editor (e.g., nano, vim, emacs) and write something.
- `> test` Save the expression in a file named test.   
- In general, if you don't know what a command does, just type `<command name> --help`. If you need more detailed information, you can do `man <command name>`. `man` stands for manual. Finally, you can get more user-friendly information by using either [`tldr`](https://tldr.sh/). 

```sh

echo "test" > test 

```

- Make 100 duplicates of this file. Let's break down the seemingly complex commands. 
- I did this using for loop (`for i in {1..100}`). Curly braces `{}` makes 1..100 integers from 1 to 100.  
- `;` is used to use multiple commands without making line breaks. 
- `$var` returns the value associated with variable. Type `name=<Your name>`. Then, type `echo $name`. You should see your name printed. Variable assignment is one of the most basic things you'll learn in any programming.  
- For novice users, I warn you that these could be too much advanced concepts. If so, don't pay too much attention to this. For now, it's enough to have intuitions. 

```sh

for i in {1..100}; do cp test "test_$i"; done  

```

Append "COVID" to the file named test_100. Note that I used `>>` (append) not `>`. 

```sh

echo "COVID" >> test_100 

```

Let's read (=`cat` (concatenate)) what's in test_100 

```sh

cat test_100 

```

Find which fine contains the character "COVID." This is literally equivalent to finding a needle in a haystack. This is a daunting task for a human researcher, but not for our robotic assistant. `grep` finds PATTERNS in each FIEL. What follows - are options (called flags): `r` (recursive), `n` (line number), `w` (match only whole words), `e` (use patterns for matching). `rnw` are for output control and `e` is for pattern selection. 

You can write `grep -r -n -w -e "COVID"`, but the simpler the better. 

* `grep`: command 

* `-rnw -e`: flags 

* `COVID`: argument (usually file or file paths)

```sh

grep -rnw -e "COVID" 

```

Let's remove (=`rm`) all the duplicate files as well as the original file. `*` (any number of characters) is a wildcard (if you want to identify a single number of character, use `?`). It finds every file whose name starts with `test_`.

```sh

rm test_* test 

```

This command should return "test_100:2:COVID." (file test_100; line number 2; COVID)

What is this black magic? Can you do the same thing using graphical interface? Which method is more efficient? I hope that this quick demonstration will give you enough sense of why learning command line could be incredibly useful. In my experience, mastering command line helps automating your research process almost from end to end. For instance, you don't need to write files from a website using your web browser. You can run `wget` command in the terminal. Better yet, you don't even need to run the command for the second time. You can write a Shell script (`*.sh`) that automates downloading, moving, and sorting multiple files. You can find one example of this from the PS239T course repository. [`copy_syllabus.sh`](https://GitHub.com/PS239T/spring_2021/blob/main/copy_syllabus.sh) automatically runs an R markdown file, produces HTML and PDF outputs, and move these files to a desired location. When I modified something in the syllabus, I just need to run this Shell script again. (No worries! I will explain what is Shell shortly.) Finally, if you need to interact with servers or supercomputers for your research, you are likely to use the command-line interface.

### UNIX Shell 

The following materials on UNIX and Shell are adapted from [the software carpentry](https://bids.GitHub.io/2015-06-04-berkeley/shell/00-intro.html.

#### Unix

UNIX is an **operating system + a set of tools (utilities)**. It was developed by AT & T employees at Bell Labs (1969-1971). From Mac OS X to Linux, many of current operation systems are some versions of UNIX. For this reason, if you're using Max OS, then you don't need to do anything else to experience UNIX. You're already all set. If you're using Windows, you need to install either GitBash (a good option if you only use Bash for Git and GitHub) or Windows Subsystem (highly recommended if your use case goes beyond Git and GitHub). For more information, see [this installation guideline](https://GitHub.com/PS239T/spring_2021/blob/main/B_Install.md) from the course repo. If you're an Windows user and don't use Windows 10, I recommend installing [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

UNIX is old, but it is still mainstream and it will be. Moreover, [the UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) ("Do One Thing And Do It Well")---minimalist, modular software development---is highly and widely influential.

#### Kernel

The kernel of UNIX is the hub of the operating system: it allocates time and memory to programs and handles the [filestore](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~martinw/unix/chap3.html) (e.g., files and directories) and communications in response to system calls. 

#### Shell

The shell is an interactive program that provides an interface between the user and the kernel. The shell interprets commands entered by the user or supplied by a Shell script, and passes them to the kernel for execution. 

#### Human-Computer interfaces

At a high level, computers do four things:

- run programs
- store data
- communicate with each other
- interact with us (through either CLI or GUI)

#### The Command Line 

This kind of interface is called a **command-line interface**, or CLI,
to distinguish it from the **graphical user interface**, or GUI, that most people now use.

The heart of a CLI is a **read-evaluate-print loop**, or REPL: when the user types a command and then presses the enter (or return) key, the computer reads it, executes it, and prints its output. The user then types another command, and so on until the user logs off.

If you're using RStudio, you can use terminal inside RStudio (next to the "Console"). (For instance, type Alt + Shift + M)

#### The Shell 

This description makes it sound as though the user sends commands directly to the computer, and the computer sends output directly to the user. In fact, there is usually a program in between called a **command shell**.

![Source: Prashant Lakhera](https://miro.medium.com/max/1032/1*GuB5q_bWOSZa-8sDg1lEDA.png)

What the user types goes into the shell; it figures out what commands to run and orders the computer to execute them. 

Note, the reason why the shell is called *the shell*: it encloses the operating system in order to hide some of its complexity and make it simpler to interact with. 

A shell is a program like any other. What's special about it is that its job is to run other programs rather than to do calculations itself. The commands are themselves programs: when they terminate, the shell gives the user another prompt ($ on our systems).

#### Bash

The most popular Unix shell is **Bash**, the Bourne Again Shell (so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne --- this is what passes for wit among programmers). Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of **Unix**, and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

#### Why Shell?

Using Bash or any other shell sometimes feels more like programming than like using a mouse. Commands are terse (often only a couple of characters long), their names are frequently cryptic, and their output is lines of text rather than something visual like a graph. 

On the other hand, the shell allows us to combine existing tools in powerful ways with only a few keystrokes and to set up pipelines to handle large volumes of data automatically.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines (explains why we learn Bash before learning Git and GitHub). As clusters and cloud computing become more popular for scientific data crunching, being able to drive them is becoming a necessary skill.

#### Our first command

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the **file system**. It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called "folders"), which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them, let's open a shell window:

```sh
jae@jae-X705UDR:~$ 
```

* jae: a specific user name 

* jae-X705UDR: your computer/server name 

* `~`: current directory (`~` = home)

* `$`: a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input; your shell may show something more elaborate.

Type the command `whoami`, then press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell.

The command's output is the ID of the current user, i.e., it shows us who the shell thinks we are:

```sh
$ whoami

# Should be your user name 
jae 
```

More specifically, when we type `whoami` the shell:

1.  finds a program called `whoami`,
2.  runs that program,
3.  displays that program's output, then
4.  displays a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.

#### Communicating to other systems

In the next unit, we'll be focusing on the structure of our own operating systems. But our operating systems rarely work in isolation; often, we are relying on the Internet to communicate with others! You can visualize this sort of communication within your own shell by asking your computer to `ping` (based on the old term for submarine sonar) an IP address provided by Google (8.8.8.8); in effect, this will test whether your Internet is working. 

```sh
$ ping 8.8.8.8
```

Note: Windows users may have to try a slightly different alternative:

```sh
$ ping -t 8.8.8.8
```

(Thanks [Paul Thissen](http://www.paulthissen.org/) for the suggestion!)

#### File system organization

Next, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd` (**print working directory**).

At any moment, our **current working directory** is our current default directory, i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in  unless we explicitly specify something else.

Here, the computer's response is `/home/jae`, which is the **home directory**:

```sh
$ pwd

/home/jae
```

**Additional tips**

You can also download files in the terminal. 

1. Install wget utility 

```sh

sudo apt-get install wget 

```
2. Download target files 

```sh 

wget https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/bionic/amd64/rstudio-1.4.1103-amd64.deb

```

> #### Home Directory
>
> The home directory path will look different on different operating systems. On Linux it will look like `/home/jae`, and on Windows it will be similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\jae`. Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.

> #### Alphabet Soup

The result is as inconsistent as the roolz uv Inglish speling, but we're stuck with it now.

To understand what a "home directory" is, let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized. At the top is the **root directory** that holds everything else.

We refer to it using a slash character `/` on its own; this is the leading slash in `/home/jae`.

Inside that directory are several other directories: `bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored), `data` (holding miscellaneous data files) `etc` (where local configuration files are stored), `tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term), and so on.

> If you're working on a Mac, the file structure will look similar, but not identical. The following image shows a file system graph for the typical Mac.

![File Directory](https://swcarpentry.GitHub.io/shell-novice/fig/home-directories.svg)

We know that our current working directory `/home/jae` is stored inside `/home` because `/home` is the first part of its name. Similarly, we know that `/home` is stored inside the root directory `/` because its name begins with `/`.

**Food for thought**

This hierarchical way of thinking about organizing things is prevalent in the design of computation systems. However, it doesn't need to be that way, especially when the system concerns something like conversations. 

```{=html}

```

> #### Path
>
> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a name, it's just a separator.

#### Listing

Let's see what's in your home directory by running `ls` (**list files and directories):

```sh
$ ls

Applications		Dropbox			Pictures
Creative Cloud Files	Google Drive		Public
Desktop			Library			Untitled.ipynb
Documents		Movies			anaconda
Downloads		Music			file.txt
```

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns.

We can make `ls` more useful by adding flags. For instance, you can make your computer show only directories in the file system using the following command. Here `-F` flag classifies files based on some types. `/` indicates directories. 

```sh
ls -F /
```

The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command.

If you want to see only directories in the current working directory, you can do the following. (Remember `^`? This wildcard identifies a single number of character. In this case, `d`.)

```sh
ls -l | grep "^d"
```

What if we want to change our current working directory? Before we do this, `pwd` shows us that we're in `/home/jae`, and `ls` without any arguments shows us that directory's contents:

```sh
$ pwd

/home/jae

$ ls

Applications		Dropbox			Pictures
Creative Cloud Files	Google Drive		Public
Desktop			Library			Untitled.ipynb
Documents		Movies			anaconda
Downloads		Music			file.txt
```

Use relative paths (e.g., `../spring_2021/references.md`) whenever it's possible so that your code is not dependable on how your system is configured. 

**Additional tips**

How can I find pdf files in `Downloads` using the terminal? Remember `*` wildcard?

```sh
cd Downloads/ 

find *.pdf
```
Also, note that you don't need to type every character. Type the first few characters then press TAB (autocomplete). This is called **tab completion**, and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.

#### Moving around

We can use `cd` (**change directory**) followed by a directory name to change our working directory. 

```sh
$ cd Desktop
```

`cd` doesn't print anything, but if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now in `/home/jae/Desktop`.

If we run `ls` without arguments now, it lists the contents of `/home/jae/Desktop`, because that's where we now are:

```sh

$ pwd

/home/jae/Desktop

```

We now know how to go down the directory tree: how do we go up? We could use an absolute path:

```sh
$ cd /home/jae/
```

but it's almost always simpler to use `cd ..` to go up one level:

```sh

$ pwd

/home/jae/Desktop

$ cd ..

```

`..` is a special directory name meaning "the directory containing this one", or more succinctly, the **parent** of the current directory. Sure enough, if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/home/jae/`:

```sh
$ pwd

/home/jae/
```

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`. If we want to display it, we can give `ls` the `-a` flag:

```sh
$ ls -a

.		.localized	Shared
..		Guest		rachel
```

`-a` stands for "show all"; it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`, such as `..`.

> #### Hidden Files: For Your Own Protection
> 
> As you can see, a bunch of other items just appeared when we enter `ls -a`. These files and directories begin with `.` followed by a name. These areusually files and directories that hold important programmatic information, not usually edited by the casual computer user. They are kept hidden so that users don't accidentally delete or edit them without knowing what they're doing.

As you can see, it also displays another special directory that's just called `.`, which means "the current working directory". It may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we'll see some uses for it soon.

> #### Phone Home
> 
> If you ever want to get to the home directory immediately, you can use theshortcut `~`. For example, type `cd ~` and you'll get back home in a jiffy. `~` will also stand in for your home directory in paths, so for instance`~/Desktop` is the same as `/home/jae/Desktop`. This only works if it isthe first character in the path: `here/there/~/elsewhere` is not `/home/jae/elsewhere`.

**Additional tips**

Okay. These exercises help us get to know about `cd` command, but not very exciting. Let's do something more concrete and potentially useful. Let's say you downloaded a file using your web browser and locate that file. How could you do that?

Your first step should be learning more about `ls` command. You can do that by Googling or typing `ls --help`. By taking a look at the documentation, you can recognize that you need to add `-t` (sort by time). Then, what's `|`? It's called pipe and it chains commands. For instance, if `<command 1> | <command 2>`, then command1's output will be command2's input. `head` list the first ten lines of a file. `-n1` flag makes it show only the first line of the output (n1).

```sh
# Don't forget using TAB completion
cd Downloads/ 

ls -t | head -n1
```

Yeah! We can actually do more cool things. How can you find the most recently downloaded PDF file? You can do this by combining the two neat tricks you learned earlier. 

```sh
ls -t | find *.pdf | head -n1 
```

#### Creating, copying, removing, and renaming files 

##### Creating files 

1. First, let's create an empty directory named exercise 

```sh

mkdir exercise 

```

2. You can check whether the directory is created by typing `ls`. If the print format is difficult to read, add `-l` flag. Did you notice the difference?

3. Let's move to `exercise` subdirectory and create a file named test 

```sh 

cd exercise ; touch test ; ls 

```

4. Read test 

```sh

cat test 

```

5. Hmn. It's empty. Let's add something there. `>` = overwrite 

```sh 

echo "something" > test ; cat test 

```

6. Yeah! Can you add more? `>>` = append 

```sh 

echo "anything" >> test ; cat test 

```

7. Removing "anything" from `test` is a little bit more complex because you need to know how to use `grep` (remember that we used this command in the very first example). Here, I just demonstrate that you can do this task using Bash and let's dig into this more when we talk about working with text files.  

```sh 

grep -v 'anything' test

```

##### Copying and Removing Files 

1. Can we make a copy of `test`? Yes!

```sh

cp test test_1; cat 

```

2. Can we make 100 copies of `test?` Yes!

You can do this 

```sh

cp test test_1 
cp test test_2
cp test test_3 

... 

```

or 

```sh 

for i in {1..100}; do cp test "test_$i"; done  

```

Which one do you like? (Again, don't focus on for loop. We'll learn it and other similar tools to deal with iterations in the later chapters.)

3. Can you remove all of `test_` files?

You can do this 

```sh 
rm test_1
rm test_2
rm test_3 

...

```

or 

```

rm test_*

```

Which one do you like?

4. Let's remove the directory. 

```sh

cd .. 

rm exercise/

```

The `rm` command should not work because `exercise` is not a file. Type `rm --help` and see which flag is going to be helpful. It might be `-d` (remove empty directories).

```
rm -d exercise/  
```

Oops. Still not working because the directory is not empty. Try this. Now, it works. 

```
rm -r exercise/ 
```

What's `-r`? It stands for recursion (e.g., . Recursion is a very powerful idea in programming and helps solving complex problems. We'll come back to it many times (e.g., `purrr::reduce` in R). 

```{=html}

```

##### Renaming files

1. Using `mv`

First, we will learn how to move files and see how it's relevant for renaming files. 

```sh

# Create two directories 
mkdir exercise_1 ; mkdir exercise_2 

# Check whether they were indeed created 
find exer*

# Create an empty file 
touch exercise_1/test 

# Move to exercise_1 and check 
cd exercise_1 ; ls 

# Move this file to exercise_2 
mv test ../exercise_2 

# Move to exercise_2 and check 
cd exercise_2 ; ls 
```

What `mv` has something to do with renaming?

* [mv] [source] [destination]

```sh

mv test new_test ; ls 

```

2. Using `rename`

`mv` is a good tool to rename one file. But how about renaming many files? (Note that your pwd is still `exercise_2` where you have `new_test` file.)

```sh

for i in {1..100}; do cp new_test "test_$i.csv"; done  

```

Then install `rename`. Either `sudo apt-get install -y rename` or `brew install rename` (MacOS).

Basic syntax: rename [flags] perlexpr (Perl Expression) files. Note that [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) is another programming language. 

```sh
# Rename every csv file to txt file 
rename 's/.csv/.txt/' *.csv

# Check 
ls -l
```

The key part is `s/.csv/.txt/` = `s/FIND/REPLACE`

Can you perform the same task using GUI? Yes, you can but it would be more time-consuming. Using the command line, you did this via just one-liner(!). [Keith Brandnam](http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/Bios/bio_keithb.html) wrote a wonderful book titled [UNIX and Perl to the Rescue! (Cambridge University Press 2012)](https://www.amazon.com/Unix-Perl-Rescue-Keith-Bradnam/dp/0521169828) that discusses how to use UNIX and Perl to deal with massively large datasets.

#### Working with CSV and text files 

1. Download a CSV file (Forbes World’s Billionaires lists from 1996-2014). For more on the data source, see [this site](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/billionaires/).

```sh
wget https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/billionaires/billionaires.csv
```

2. Read the first two lines. We have learned `cat`, `|`, and `head` already. So, there's nothing new here.

**Additional tips 1**
If you have a large text file, the fact that `cat` prints everything at once is inconvenient. The alternative using `less`. 

```sh
cat billionaires.csv | head -n2
```

3. Check the size of the dataset (2615 rows). So, there are 2014 observations (n-1 because of the header). `wc` prints newline, word, and byte counts for each file. If you run `wc` without `-l` flag, you get the following: `2615 (line) 20433 (word) 607861 (byte) billionaires.csv`

```sh
wc -l billionaires.csv
```

4. How about the number of columns? `sed` is a stream editor and very powerful when it's used to filter text in a pipeline. For more information, see [this article](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html). You've already seen `s/FIND/REPLACE`. Here, the pattern we are using is `s/delimiter/\n/g`. We've seen that the delimiter is `,`, so that's what I plugged in the command below. 

```sh
head -1 billionaires.csv | sed 's/,/\n/g' | nl
```

**Additional tips 2**
The other cool command for text parsing is `awk`. This command is especially useful for filtering.

1. This is same as using `cat` (basically, printing). So, what's new? 

```sh
awk '{print}' billionaires.csv 
```

2. This is new. 

```sh
awk '/China/ {print}' billionaires.csv
```

3. Let's see only the five rows. We filtered rows so that the every row in the final dataset contains 'China'. 

```sh
awk '/China/ {print}' billionaires.csv | head -n5 
```

4. You can also get the numbers of these rows. 

```sh
awk '/China/ {print NR}' billionaires.csv 
```

#### User roles and file permissions

1. If you need admin access, use `sudo`. For instance, `sudo apt-get install <package name>`.

2. To run a Shell script (.sh), you need to change its file mode. You can make the script executable by typing `chmod +x <Shell script>`. Then, you can run it by typing `./pdf_copy_sh.` `.` refers the current working directory. Other options: `sh pdf_copy_sh.` or `bash pdf_copy_sh.` I use `./pdf_copy_sh.`

#### Writing your first Shell script (.sh)

Finally, we're learning how to write a Shell script (a file that ends with .sh). Here I show how to write a Shell script that creates a subdirectory called `/pdfs` under `/Download` directory, then find PDF files in `/Download` and copy those files to `pdfs`. Essentially, this Shell script creates a backup. Name this Shell script as 'pdf_copy.sh.' Pay attention to this example as a similar exercise is going to be part of your second assignment. 

```sh

#!/bin/sh # Stating this is a Shell script. 

mkdir /home/jae/Downloads/pdfs # Obviously, in your case this file path should be incorrect.

cd Download

cp *.pdf pdfs/ 

echo "Copied pdfs"

```

**Additional tips**

Using Make [TBD]

## Git and GitHub

### Version control system 

**The most important point**

* Backup != Version control

* If you do version control, you need to save your **raw data** in your hard disk, external drive, or cloud, but nothing else. In other words, anything that you are going to change should be subject to version control (also, it's not same as saving your code with names like 20200120_Kim or something like that). Below, I will explain what is version control and how to do it using Git and GitHub. 

![Why you should do version control](https://i2.wp.com/cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/399/1*7HHA_UkjUK7wp7qP4CYu1g.png?zoom=1.75&w=456&ssl=1)

According to [GitHub Guides](https://guides.GitHub.com), a version control system "tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together". Specifically, it helps to track the following information:

* Which changes were made?
* Who made the changes?
* When were the changes made?
* Why were changes needed?

Git is a case of a [distributed version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control), common in open source and commercial software development. This is no surprising given that Git [was originally created](https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/6/121) to deal with Linux kernal development. 

**Food for thought**

If you're curious about how the Internet works, learn one of the key ideas of the Internet: [end-to-end principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle). This also explains why [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) matters. 

The following images, from [Pro Git](git-scm.com), show how a centralized (e.g., CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) and decentralized VCS (e.g., Git, Mercurial, Bazzar or Darcs) works differently. 

![Centralized version control system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/centralized.png)

Figure 2. Centralized VCS.

![Decentralized version control system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/distributed.png)

Figure 3. Decentralized VCS.

For more information on the varieties of version control systems, please read [Petr Baudis's review](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4490/4c70bc91e1bed4fe02b9e2282f031b7c90ea.pdf) on that subject.

<p The Basics of Git and GitHub, GitHub Training & Guides /p>

```

### Setup 

#### Signup 

1. Make sure you have installed Git ([[tutorial]](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git)). 

```sh
git --version 
# git version 2.xx.x
```

2. If you haven't, sign up a GitHub account: https://github.com/
  - If you're a student, also sign up for GitHub Student Developer Pack: https://education.github.com/pack Basically, you can get a GitHub pro account for free (so why not?).
  
3. Access GitHub either using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) or Secure Shell (SSH).

**HTTPS**

1. Create a personal access token. Follow this guideline: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

2. Store your credential somewhere safe. You can use an R package like this [gitcreds](https://gitcreds.r-lib.org/) and [credentials](https://docs.ropensci.org/credentials/) to do so.

```{r eval = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(gitcreds)

# First time only 
gitcreds_set()

# Check 
gitcreds_get()
```
3. If you get asked to provide your password when you pull or push, the password should be your GitHub token (to be precise, personal access token). 

**SSH**

If possible, I highly recommend using SSH. Using SSH is safer and also makes connecting GitHub easier. SSH has two keys (public and private). Public key could be stored on any server (e.g., GitHub) and private key could be saved in your client (e.g., your laptop). Only when the two are matched, the system unlocks. 

1. First, read [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh ) and create SSH keys.

2. Second, read [this tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html) and check the keys and provide the public key to GitHub and add private key to ssh-agent.

Next time, if you want to use SSH, remember the following.

```sh
# SSH
git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git

# HTTPS
https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git
```

**Additional tips**

When you try to clone a git repo, you cna get the links like the above by clicking CODE action button on GitHub.

![](misc/ssh.png)

#### Configurations 

1. Method 1: using the terminal 

```sh

# User name and email 
$ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
$ git config --global user.email username@school.extension

```

2. Method 2: using RStudio (if you insist using R)

```{r eval=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "<Firstname Lastname>",
               user.email = "<username@school.extension>")
```

You're all set!

### Cloning a repository 

Let's clone a repository. As a test, I will clone the GitHub repository for the course I'm co-teaching in Spring 2021.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PS239T/spring_2021
```

If you `cd spring_2021/` you can move to the cloned course repository. Cloning: copying a public GitHub repo (remote) -> Your machine 

If I made some changes in the remote repo, you can make them applied to your local copy by typing `git pull`. You may get promoted to provide password. Then type the following to switch the remote URL's address from HTTPS to SSH.

```sh
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:[user]/[repo]
```

If this doesn't work and get the following error, then try the following (this assumes that your SSH key was removed). If you're using Mac, try this instead: `ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa` 

```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

If you still face difficulties, see [this stack overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13509293/git-fatal-could-not-read-from-remote-repository).

If you screwed something up in your local copy, you can just overwrite the local copy using the remote repo and make it exactly looks like the latter. 

```sh
# Download content from a remote repo 
git fetch origin

# Going back to origin/main
git reset --hard origin/main 

# Remove local files 
git clean -f
```

Note that the default branch name changed from master to main: https://github.com/github/renaming (Finally!) For this reason, if you're interacting with old repositories, the main branch name is likely master.

**Additional tips**
You can see cloning and forking on GitHub and they sound similar. Let me differentiate them.

* Cloning: creating a local copy of a **public** GitHub repo. In this case, you have writing access to the repo.

* Forking (for open source projects): creating a copy of a **public** GitHub repo to your GitHub account then you can clone it. In this case, you don't have writing access to the repo. If you want your changes reflected in the original repo, you need to create pull requests. Don't worry about pull requests as I will explain the concept shortly. For more information, see [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop). 

### Making a repository 

Create a new directory and move to it. 

```sh 
$ mkdir code_exercise 
$ cd code_exercise 
```

```sh
$ git init 
```

Alternatively, you can create a Git repository via GitHub and then clone it on your local machine. Perhaps, it is an easier path for new users (I also do this all the time). When you do this, I highly recommend add README (more on why we do this in the following subection).

```sh
$ git clone /path/to/repository
```

**Additional tips**
If you're unfamiliar with basic Git commands, then please refer to [this Git cheet sheet](http://rogerdudler.GitHub.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf).

### Commit changes 

These feature show how Git works as a version control system. 

If you edited files or added new ones, then you need to update your repository. In Git terms, this action is called committing changes. 

My current pwd is `spring_2021`. I created a text file named `test` that contains text `jae`. You can check the file exists by typing `find "test"`.

The following is a typical workflow to reflect this change to the remote. 

```sh
$ git status # check what's changed. 
$ git add . # update every change. In Git terms, you're staging. 
$ git add file_name # or stage a specific file.
$ git commit -m "your comment" # your comment for the commit. 
$ git push origin main # commit the change. Origin is a default name given to a server by Git. `origin main` are optional. 
```

Another image from [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/about/staging-area) well illustrates this process.

![Git Workflow](https://git-scm.com/images/about/index1@2x.png)

If you made a mistake, don't panic. You can't revert the process.

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~1 # if you still want to keep the change, but you go back to t-1 
git reset --hard HEAD~1 # if you're sure the change is unnecessary 
```

Writing an informative commit is important. To learn how to do this better, see the following video: 

```{=html}

```

### Push and pull (or fetch)

These features show how Git works as a collaboration tool. 

If you have not already done, let's clone PS239T directory on your local machine.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/PS239T/spring_2021 # clone 
```

**Additional tips 1**

If you try to remove `spring_2021` using `rm -r spring_2021/`, you will get an error about write-protected regular file. Then, try `rm -rf spring_2021/`. 

Then, let's learn more about the repository.

```sh
$ git remote -v 
```

You should see something like the following:

```sh
origin	git@github.com:PS239T/spring_2021 (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:PS239T/spring_2021 (push)
```

If you want to see more information, then type `git remote show origin`

Previously, we learned how to send your data save in the local machine to the remote (the GitHub server). You can do that by editing or creating files, committing, and then typing **git push**. 

Instead, if you want to update your local data with the remote data, then you can type **git pull origin** (something like pwd in bash). Alternatively, you can use fetch (retrieve data from a remote). When you do that, Git retrieves the data and merge it into your local data.

```sh
$ git fetch origin
```

**Additional tips 2**

Developers usually use PR to refer pull requests. When you are making PRs, it's recommend to scope down (small PRs) because they are easier on reviewers and to test. To learn about how to accomplish this, see [this blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/31/how-to-scope-down-prs/) by Sarah Drasner.

### Branching 

It's an advanced feature of Git's version control system that allows developers to "diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line" according to [Scott Chacon and Ben Straub](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching). 

If you start working on a new feature, then create a new branch. 

```sh
$ git branch new_features
$ git checkout new_features
```

You can see the newly created branch by typing **git branch**.

In short, branching makes Git [works like](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) a mini file system.


### Other useful commands 

1. For tracking history

```sh
$ git diff # to see what changed (e.g., inside a file)
$ git log # to track who committed what
$ git log -S <pattern> # you can find a log that contains the pattern 
$ git checkout # to recover old files 
$ git revert # revert to the previous commit 
```

2. For removing and renaming files 

```sh
$ git rm file_name # remove 
$ git mv old_file_name new_file_name # rename a file 
```

How about removing a directory only from the GitHub but not local?

```sh
git rm -r --cached <directory>
git commit -m "<message>"
git push
```

### Collaborations 

Two options. 

* Sharing a repository (suitable for a private project).
* Fork and pull (suitable for an open source project). 
    ​    * The one who maintains the repository becomes the maintainer. 
    ​    * The others can [fork](https://help.GitHub.com/articles/about-forks/), make changes, and even [pull](https://help.GitHub.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) them back.

### Deployment: GitHub Pages 

GitHub pages are also useful to deploy websites. This book is deployed by GitHub Pages.

### Using Git clients

Okay. Using command line Git helps you understand how Git works. Also, you know that if possible I'd love to do almost everything in the terminal. However, using command line Git is sometimes too complex or too buggy. An alternative is using Git clients (GUI). 

I use [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) because it's free, works on almost every OS (Windows, Mac and Linux) and quite versatile. It's especially useful to trace and understand your development process (e.g., commits, branches, pull requests, comments). I heard also positive things about [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (Windows and Mac) and [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (Windows). 

## Getting started in R 

### RStudio 

There are two main ways of interacting with R: using the console or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code).

If R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a `>` prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using `Ctrl-Enter`; `Command-Enter` will also work on Macs), R will try to execute it, and when ready, show the results and come back with a new `>`-prompt to wait for new commands. This is the equivalent of the `$` in your terminal. 

### Basic Syntax

**Comments**

Use `#` signs to comment. Comment liberally in your R scripts. Anything to the right of a `#` is ignored by R. For those of you familiar with other languages, there is no doc string, or equivalent to `"""` in R.

**Assignment operator**

`<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is `3`. The arrow can be read as 3 **goes into** `x`.  You can also use `=` for assignments. 

```{r}
USweird <- "Why use lb for pound!" # Use this

"Why use lb for pound!" = USweird
```

Nonetheless, *can* does not mean you *should*. It is good practice to use `<-` for assignments. `=` should only be used to specify the values of arguments of functions. This is what Google and Hadley Wickham recommend as well. If they don't convince you enough, here's [a real example](https://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/assignment-operators-in-r-vs/).

```{r}

mean(x = 1:10) # Does it save x?
rm(x)

mean(x <- 1:10) # Does it save x?
rm(x)

```

**Printing**

In R, the contents of an object can be printed by either simply executing the the object name or calling the ```print()``` function.

**Help**

* `?` + object opens a help page for that specific object
* `??` + object searches help pages containing the name of the object

```{r, eval = FALSE}

?mean
??mean
help(mean)

# The above three will do same. 

example(ls) # provides example for how to use ls 

help.search("visualization") # search functions and packages that have "visualization" in their descriptions

```

### Environment 

Environment = a collection of pairs 

#### Objects 

- List objects in your current environment

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Create a numeric object 
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

# List the object 
ls()

# Remove the object 
rm(x)

```

- Remove objects from your current environment

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

# Create an object 
x <- 5

# Remove the object 
rm(x)

```

- Remove all objects from your current environment

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Create an object 
a <- 7

b <- 3

# Remove the object 
rm(list = ls())

```

- Force memory release 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Garbage collect; for more information, type ?gc() 

gc()

```

#### Packages 

`install.packages(package-name)` will download a package from one of the CRAN mirrors assuming that a binary is available for your operating system. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# From CRAN
install.packages("dplyr") 

# Load package 
library(dplyr)

# From GitHub 
devtools::install_GitHub("jaeyk/tidytweetjson") # my own package 

# Unload package 
# detach("package:stats", unload=TRUE)

```

**Tips**

If you have multiple packages to install, then please consider using pacman package. The following is the example. First, you install pacman. Then, you load several libraries by using `p_load()` method.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(
  ggplot2,
  dplyr, 
  broom
)
```

If you don't like to use `pacman`, then the other option is to create a list (we're going to learn what is list soon).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pkgs <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "broom")

install.packages(pkgs)
```
  
Still, we have to write two lines. The simpler, the better, right? Here's another approach that can simplify the code further.

Note that `lapply()` applies (there's a family of apply functions) a function to a list. In this case, library to pkgs. apply is an advanced concept, which is related to anonymous functions. We will learn about it later when we study functions.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

inst <- lapply(pkgs, library, 
               character.only = TRUE)
  
```

## Project-oriented research

### Computational reproducibility

* Replication = code + data 

* Computational reproduciblity = code + data + environment + distribution 

* Reproducibility checklist by [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/)

    1. Start with science (avoid vague questions and concepts)
    
    2. Don't do things by hand (not only about automation but also documentation)
    
    3. Don't point and click (same problem)
    
    4. Teach a computer (automation also solves documentation to some extent)
    
    5. Use some version control 
    
    6. Don't save output (instead keep the input and code)
    
    7. Set your seed 
    
    8. Think about the entire pipeline 

#### Setup

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse, # tidyverse
  here # computational reproducibility
)
```

#### Motivation 

Why do you need to make your research project computationally reproducible?

For your self-interest and public benefits. 

![](https://GitHub.com/dlab-berkeley/efficient-reproducible-project-management-in-R/blob/master/misc/screenshot.png?raw=true)

#### How to organize files in a project 

You won't be able to reproduce your project unless it is efficiently organized. 

Step 1. [**Environment**](https://environments.rstudio.com/) is part of your project. If someone can't reproduce your environment, they won't be able to run your code.

- Launch R Studio. Tools > Global Options. You **should not** check Restore .RData into workspace at startup. Also, set saving workspace option to **NEVER.**

Step 2. For each project, create a project directory named after the project. 

name_of_the_project 

- data: 
  - raw 
  - processed (all processed, cleaned, and tided)
- figures 
- packrat (optional) 
- reports (PDF, HTML, TEX, etc.,) 
- results (model outcomes, etc.,)
- scripts (i.e., functions)
- .gitignore (for Git)
- name_of_project.Rproj (for R)
- README.md (for Git) 

![Working directory structure example](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/img/working-directory-structure.png)


```{r eval = FALSE}

# Don't name it a project. Use a name that's more informative. For instance, us_election not my_project.

dir.create("../us_election")

```

Step 3. Launch R Studio. Choose File > New project > Browse existing directories > Create project This allows each project has its own workspace. 

Step 4. Organize files by putting them in separate subdirectories and naming them in a sensible way.

- Treat raw data as read only (raw data should be RAW!) and put in the `data` subdirectory.

    - Again, note that version control does not need replace backup. You still need to backup your raw data. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "data"))

```

- Separate read-only data from processed data and put in the `processed_data` subdirectory.

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "processed_data"))

```

- Put your code in the `src` subdirectory. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "src"))

```

- Put generated outputs (e.g., tables, figures) in the `outputs` subdirectory and treat them as disposable.

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "outputs"))

```

- Put your custom functions in the `functions` subdirectory. You can gather some of these functions and distribute them as an open-source library. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

dir.create(here::here("us_election", "src"))

```

**Challenge**

Set a project structure for a project named "starwars". 

#### How to organize code in a R markdown file 

- In addition to environment, **workflow** is an important component of project efficiency and reproducibility. 

- What is R markdown? An R package, developed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/), that provides an authoring framework for data science. Xie is also a developer of many widely popular R packages such as `knitr`, [`xaringan`](https://GitHub.com/yihui/xaringan) (cool kids use xaringan not [Beamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)) these days), `blogdown` (used to create [my personal website](https://jaeyk.GitHub.io/)), and `bookdown` (used to create this book) among many others.

  - Many applications: [reports](https://rstudio.GitHub.io/distill/basics.html), [presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html), [dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), [websites](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/websites.html)  
  - Check out [Communicating with R markdown workshop](https://ysc-rmarkdown.netlify.app/) by [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) (RStudio)
    - Alison Hill is a co-author of [`blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown.`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) 
  - Key strengths: dynamic reporting + reproducible science + easy deployment

- R Markdown basic syntax 

```{r}
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

- Use these section headers to indicate workflow.

```{r}
# Import packages and data
# Tidy data
# Wrangle data
# Model data
# Visualize data
```

- Press `ctrl + shift + o`. You can see a document outline based on these headers. This is a nice feature for finding code you need to focus. 

- If your project's scale is large, then divide these sections into files, number, and save them in `code` subdirectory. 

   - 01_wrangling.Rmd
   - 02_modeling.Rmd 
   ... 

#### Making a project computationally reproducible

- `setwd()`: set a working directory. 

- Note that using `setwd()` is not a reproducible way to set up your project. For instance, none will be able to run the following code except me.

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Set a working directory 
setwd("/home/jae/starwars")

# Do something 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point()

# Export the object. 
# dot means the working directory set by setwd()
ggsave("./outputs/example.png") # This is called relative path 

```

- Instead, learn how to use `here()`'.

   - Key idea: separate workflow (e.g., workspace information) from products (code and data). For more information, read Jenny Bryan's wonderful piece on [project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).

   - Example 

```{r eval = FALSE}

# New: Reproducible 

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point()

ggsave(here("project", "outputs", "example.png"))

```

   - How `here` works 

   `here()` function shows what's the top-level project directory. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

here::here()

```
   - Build a path including subdirectories 

```{r eval = FALSE}

here::here("project", "outputs")
           #depth 1   #depth 2
```
   - How `here` defines the top-level project directory. The following list came from [the here package vignette](https://GitHub.com/jennybc/here_here)).

      - Is a file named .here present?
      - Is this an RStudio Project? (**Note that we already set up an RStudio Project!** So, if you use RStudio's project feature, then you are ready to use `here`.)
      - Is this an R package? Does it have a DESCRIPTION file?
      - Is this a remake project? Does it have a file named `remake.yml`?
      - Is this a projectile project? Does it have a file named `.projectile`?
      - Is this a checkout from a version control system? Does it have a directory named `.git` or `.svn`? Currently, only Git and Subversion are supported.

      - If there's no match then use `set_here()` to create an empty `.here` file. 

**Challenge**

1. Can you define computational reproducibility? 
2. Can you explain why sharing code and data is not enough for computational reproducibility

## Writing code: How to code like a professional

### Write readable code

- What is code style?

> Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style. - [Google Style Guides](https://google.GitHub.io/styleguide/)

<p> Code smells and feels - Jenny Bryan</p>

<p> "Code smell" is an evocative term for that vague feeling of unease we get when reading certain bits of code. It's not necessarily wrong, but neither is it obviously correct. We may be reluctant to work on such code, because past experience suggests it's going to be fiddly and bug-prone. In contrast, there's another type of code that just feels good to read and work on. What's the difference? If we can be more precise about code smells and feels, we can be intentional about writing code that is easier and more pleasant to work on. I've been fortunate to spend the last couple years embedded in a group of developers working on the tidyverse and r-lib packages. Based on this experience, I'll talk about specific code smells and deodorizing strategies for R. - Jenny Bryan</p>

- Naming matters 

  - When naming files, remember the following three rules:
      - Machine readable (avoid spaces, punctuation, periods, and any other special characters except _ and -)
      - Human readable (should be meaningful. No text1, image1, etc.,)
      - Ordering (e.g., 01, 02, 03,  ... )
    

```{r, eval= FALSE}
# Good
fit_models.R

# Bad
fit models.R
```

  - When naming objects:
      - Don't use special characters.
      - Don't capitalize.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good 
day_one
    
# Bad 
DayOne
```

  - When naming functions:
      - Don't use special characters.
      - Don't capitalize.
      - Use `verbs` instead of `nouns`. (Functions do something!)
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good 
run_rdd 

# Bad 
rdd
```
    
- Spacing 

Some people do spacing by pressing the Tab key and others do it by pressing the Space key multiple times (and this is a serious subject).

```{=html}

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsoOG6ZeyUI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p> Tabs versus Spaces </p>

```


```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Good
x[, 1] 

mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) 

# Bad

x[,1]

mean (x, na.rm = TRUE)

```

- Indenting 

Indent at least 4 spaces. Note that some people, including none other than [Roger Peng](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/07/27/why-i-indent-my-code-8-spaces/), indent 8 spaces. The below example shows how you can change the default indentation setting using RStudio configuration.
    
![Roger Peng's tweet](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuHHs7yXgAAFWeh?format=jpg&name=360x360)

```{r eval= FALSE}
# Good
if (y < 0) {
  message("y is negative")
}

# Bad
if (y < 0) {
message("Y is negative")}
```

- Long lines

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
do_something_very_complicated(
  something = "that",
  requires = many,
  arguments = "some of which may be long"
)

# Bad
do_something_very_complicated("that", requires = many, arguments =
                              "some of which may be long"
                              )
```

- Comments 
   - Use comments to explain your decisions. 
   - But, show your code; Do not try to explain your code by comments.
   - Also, try to comment out rather than delete the code that you experiment with. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Average sleep hours of Jae
jae %>%
  # By week
  group_by(week) %>%
  # Mean sleep hours 
  summarise(week_sleep = mean(sleep, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Pipes (chaining commands)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize_if(is.numeric, mean) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  gather(measure, value, -Species) %>%
  arrange(value)

# Bad
iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarize_all(mean) %>%
ungroup %>% gather(measure, value, -Species) %>%
arrange(value)
```

- Additional tips 

- Use `lintr` to check whether your code complies with a recommended style guideline (e.g., `tidyverse`) and `styler` package to format your code according to the style guideline.

![how lintr works](https://camo.GitHubusercontent.com/6cb80270269165a8d3046d2da03cbf2b8f19ee2f/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f61635632374e562e676966)

### Write reusable code 

- Pasting 

> Copy-and-paste programming, sometimes referred to as just pasting, is the production of highly repetitive computer programming code, as produced by copy and paste operations. It is primarily a pejorative term; those who use the term are often implying a lack of programming competence. It may also be the result of technology limitations (e.g., an insufficiently expressive development environment) as subroutines or libraries would normally be used instead. However, there are occasions when copy-and-paste programming is considered acceptable or necessary, such as for boilerplate, loop unrolling (when not supported automatically by the compiler), or certain programming idioms, and it is supported by some source code editors in the form of snippets. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-and-paste_programming) 

- It's okay for pasting for the first attempt to solve a problem. But if you copy and paste three times (a.k.a. [Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)) in programming), something's wrong. You're working too hard. You need to be lazy. What do I mean and how can you do that?

- The following exercise was inspired by [Wickham's example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html).

- Let's imagine `df` is a survey dataset. 

    - `a, b, c, d` = Survey questions 

    - `-99`: non-responses 
    
    - Your goal: replace `-99` with `NA` 
    
```{r}

# Data

set.seed(1234) # for reproducibility 

df <- tibble("a" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE),
             "b" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE),
             "c" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE),
             "d" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5 , replace= TRUE))
           
```

```{r}

# Copy and paste 
df$a[df$a == -99] <- NA
df$b[df$b == -99] <- NA
df$c[df$c == -99] <- NA
df$d[df$d == -99] <- NA

df
```

- Using a function 
   - function: input + computation + output 
   - If you write a function, you gain efficiency because you don't need to copy and paste the computation part. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Create a custom function
fix_missing <- function(x) { # INPUT
  x[x == -99] <- NA # COMPUTATION
  x # OUTPUT 
}

# Apply the function to each column (vector)
# This iterated part can and should be automated.
df$a <- fix_missing(df$a)
df$b <- fix_missing(df$b)
df$c <- fix_missing(df$c)
df$d <- fix_missing(df$d)

df
```

- Automation
   - Many options for automation in R: `for loop`, `apply` family, etc. 
   - Here's a tidy solution comes from `purrr` package.
   - The power and joy of one-liner. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

df <- purrr::map_df(df, fix_missing) # What is this magic? We will unpack the blackbox (`map_df()`) later.

df
```

- Takeaways

1. Your code becomes more reusable, when it's easier to **change, debug, and scale up**. Don't repeat yourself and embrace the power of lazy programming. 

> Lazy, because only lazy programmers will want to write the kind of tools that might replace them in the end. Lazy, because only a lazy programmer will avoid writing monotonous, repetitive code—thus avoiding redundancy, the enemy of software maintenance and flexible refactoring. Mostly, the tools and processes that come out of this endeavor fired by laziness will speed up the production. -  [Philipp Lenssen](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html)
  
2. Only when your code becomes **reusable**, you would become **efficient** in your data work. Otherwise, you need to start from scratch or copy and paste, when you work on a new project.

> Code reuse aims to save time and resources and reduce redundancy by taking advantage of assets that have already been created in some form within the software product development process.[2] The key idea in reuse is that parts of a computer program written at one time can be or should be used in the construction of other programs written at a later time. - Wikipedia 

### Test your code systematically [TBD]

### Asking questions: Minimal reproducible example

- Chances are you're going to use StackOverFlow a lot to solve a pressing problem you face. However, other can't understand/be interested in your problem unless you can provide an example which they can understand with minimal efforts. Such example is called a minimal reproducible example. 

- Read [this StackOverFlow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) to understand the concept and best practices.

- Simply put, a MRE consists of the following items:

    - A minimal dataset 
    - The minimal burnable code
    - The necessary information on package, R version, system (use `sessionInfo()`)
    - A seed for reproducibility (`set.seed()`), if you used a random process.
