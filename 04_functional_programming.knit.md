# Automating repeated things {#functional_programming}



> Anything that can be automated should be automated. Do as little as possible by hand. Do as much as possible with functions. 
- Hadley Wickham

This chapter helps you to step up your R skills with functional programming. The `purrr` package provides easy-to-use tools to automate repeated things in your entire R workflow (e.g., wrangling, modeling, and visualization). The result is cleaner, faster, more readable, and extendable code.

## Learning objectives

0.  How to use control flow in R using `if_`, `for loop`, and `apply` 
1.  How to use `map()` to automate workflow in a cleaner, faster, and more extendable way  
2.  How to use `map2()` and `pmap()` to avoid writing nested loops
3.  How to use `map()` and `glue()` to automate creating multiple plots
4.  How to use `reduce()` to automate joining multiple dataframes
5.  How to use `slowly()` and `future_` to make the automation process either slower or faster
6.  How to use `safely()` and `possibly()` to make error handling easier
7.  How to develop your data products (e.g., R packages, Shiny apps)
