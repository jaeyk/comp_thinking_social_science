# High-dimensional data {#machine_learning}



## The Big Picture

- The rise of high-dimensional data. The new data frontiers in social sciences---text ([Gentzkow et al. 2019](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/text-as-data.pdf); [Grimmer and Stewart 2013](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24572662.pdf?casa_token=SQdSI4R_VdwAAAAA:4QiVLhCXqr9f0qNMM9U75EL5JbDxxnXxUxyIfDf0U8ZzQx9szc0xVqaU6DXG4nHyZiNkvcwGlgD6H0Lxj3y0ULHwgkf1MZt8-9TPVtkEH9I4AHgbTg)) and and image ([Joo and Steinert-Threlkeld 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01544))---are all high-dimensional data. 

    - 1000 common English words for 30-word tweets: $1000^{30}$ similar to N of atoms in the universe ([Gentzkow et al. 2019](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/text-as-data.pdf))

- The rise of the new approach: statistics + computer science = machine learning 

- Statistical inference 

    - $y$ <- some probability models (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression) <- $x$
       
    - $y$ = $X\beta$ + $\epsilon$
        
    - The goal is to estimate $\beta$

- Machine learning 

    - $y$ <- unknown <- $x$ 
    
    - $y$ <-> decision trees, neutral nets <-> $x$
        
    - For the main idea behind prediction modeling, see Breiman, Leo (Berkeley stat faculty who passed away in 2005). ["Statistical modeling: The two cultures (with comments and a rejoinder by the author)."](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726) *Statistical science* 16, no. 3 (2001): 199-231.
    
    - "The problem is to find an algorithm $f(x)$ such that for future $x$ in a test set, $f(x)$ will be a good predictor of $y$."
    
    - "There are **two cultures** in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a **given** **stochastic data model**. The other uses **algorithmic models** and treats the data mechanism as **unknown**."


- How ML differs from econometrics? 

- A review by Athey, Susan, and Guido W. Imbens. ["Machine learning methods that economists should know about."](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-economics-080217-053433) *Annual Review of Economics* 11 (2019): 685-725.
        
- Stat:
  
    - Specifying a target (i.e., an estimand)

    - Fitting a model to data using an objective function (e.g., the sum of squared errors)

    - Reporting point estimates (effect size) and standard errors (uncertainty)

    - Validation by yes-no using goodness-of-fit tests and residual examination

- ML: 

    - Developing algorithms (estimating *f(x)*)

    - Prediction power, not structural/causal parameters

    - Basically, high-dimensional data statistics (N < P)

    - The major problem is to avoid ["the curse of dimensionality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) ([too many features - > overfitting](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-curse-of-dimensionality-50dc6e49aa1e))

    - Validation: out-of-sample comparisons (cross-validation) not in-sample goodness-of-fit measures

    - So, it's curve-fitting, but the primary focus is unseen (test data), not seen data (training data)

- A quick review on ML lingos for those trained in econometrics 

    - Sample to estimate parameters = Training sample
  
    - Estimating the model = Being trained 
    
    - Regressors, covariates, or predictors = Features 
  
    - Regression parameters = weights 
  
    - Prediction problems = Supervised (some $y$ are known) + Unsupervised ($y$ unknown)
