## Why computational thinking 
- If social scientists want to know how to work smart and not just hard, they need to take full advantage of the power of modern programming languages, and that power is **automation**. 

- Let's think about the following two cases.

  - Case 1: Suppose a social scientist needs to collect data on civic organizations in the United States from websites, Internal Revenue Service reports, and social media posts. As the number of these organizations is large, the researcher could not collect a large volume of data from diverse sources, so they would hire undergraduates and distribute tasks among them. This is a typical data collection plan in social science research, and it is labor-intensive. Automation is not part of the game plan. Yet, it is critical for so many reasons. Because the process is costly, no one is likely to either replicate or update the data collection effort. Put differently, without making the process efficient, it is difficult for it to be reproducible and scalable. 

  - Case 2: An alternative is to write computer programs that collect such data automatically, parse them, and store them in interconnected databases. Additionally, someone may need to maintain and validate the quality of the data infrastructure. Nevertheless, this approach lowers the cost of the data collection process, thereby substantially increasing the reproducibility and scalability of the process. Furthermore, the researcher can document their code and publicly share it using their GitHub repository or even gather some of the functions they used and distribute them as open-source libraries. 
  
- Programming is as valuable a skill as writing in social science research. The extent to which a researcher can automate the research process can determine its efficiency, reproducibility, and scalability.
  
> Every modern statistical and data analysis problem needs code to solve it. You shouldn’t learn just the basics of programming, spend some time gaining mastery. Improving your programming skills pays off because code is a **force multiplier**: once you’ve solved a problem once, code allows you to solve it much faster in the future. As your programming skill increases, the generality of your solutions improves: you solve not just the precise problem you encountered, but a wider class of related problems (in this way programming skill is very much like mathematical skill). Finally, sharing your code with others allows them to benefit from your experience. - [Hadley Wickham](https://imstat.org/2014/12/16/hadley-wickham-impact-the-world-by-being-useful/)

## Computational way of thinking about data 

### Structure 
- Structured data (Excel spreadsheets, CSVs)
  - Tidy data 
- Semi-structured data 
  - HTML/CSS: Websites 
  - JSON/XML: APIs

### Dimension
- Low-dimensional data (n > p)
  - Survey, experimental, and administrative data 
- High-dimensional data (n < p)
  - Text, speech, image, video, etc. 

### Size 
- Data fit in your laptop's memory 
- Data don't fit in your laptop's memory (=big data)
