## The Big Picture

-   Automating the process of turning semi-structured data (input) into structured data (output)

## What is semi-structured data?

> Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not obey the tabular structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. Therefore, it is also known as a self-describing structure. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-structured_data#:~:text=Semi%2Dstructured%20data%20is%20a,and%20fields%20within%20the%20data.)

-   Examples: HTML (e.g., websites), XML (e.g., government data), JSON (e.g., social media API)

Below is how JSON (tweet) looks like. 


- A tree-like structure 

- Keys and values (key: value) 
 
{
  "created_at": "Thu Apr 06 15:24:15 +0000 2017",
  "id_str": "850006245121695744",
  "text": "1\/ Today we\u2019re sharing our vision for the future of the Twitter API platform!\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/XweGngmxlP",
  "user": {
    "id": 2244994945,
    "name": "Twitter Dev",
    "screen_name": "TwitterDev",
    "location": "Internet",
    "url": "https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/",
    "description": "Your official source for Twitter Platform news, updates & events. Need technical help? Visit https:\/\/twittercommunity.com\/ \u2328\ufe0f #TapIntoTwitter"
  }
}

-   Why should we care about semi-structured data?

    -   Because this is what the data frontier looks like: \# of unstructured data \> \# of semi-structured data \> \# of structured data
    -   There are easy and fast ways to turn semi-structured data into structured data (ideally in a tidy format) using R, Python, and command-line tools. See my own examples ([tidyethnicnews](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidyethnicnews) and [tidytweetjson](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidytweetjson)).

## Workflow

1.  Import/connect to a semi-structured file using `rvest,` `jsonlite,` `xml2,` `pdftools,` `tidyjson`, etc.

2.  Define target elements in a single file and extract them

-   [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package providers `parse_` functions that are useful for vector parsing.

-   [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) package for string manipulations (e.g., using regular expressions in a tidy way). Quite useful for parsing PDF files (see [this example](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-04-03-beer-and-pdftools-a-vignette/)).

-   [`rvest`](https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest) package for parsing HTML (R equivalent to `beautiful soup` in Python)

-   [`tidyjson`](https://github.com/sailthru/tidyjson) package for parsing JSON data

3.  Create a list of files (in this case URLs) to parse

4.  Write a parsing function

5.  Automate parsing process

## HTML/CSS: web scraping

Let's go back to the example we covered in the earlier chapter of the book. 

```{r}

url_list <- c(
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University",
  "https://DLAB"
)
```

* Step 1: Inspection 

Examine the Berkeley website so that we could identify a node that indicates the school's motto. Then, if you're using Chrome, draw your interest elements, then `right click > inspect > copy full xpath.`

```{r, eval = FALSE}

url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"

download.file(url, destfile = "scraped_page.html", quiet = TRUE)

target <- read_html("scraped_page.html")

# If you want character vector output
target %>%
  html_nodes(xpath = "/html/body/div[3]/div[3]/div[5]/div[1]/table[1]") %>%
  html_text() 

# If you want table output 
target %>%
  html_nodes(xpath = "/html/body/div[3]/div[3]/div[5]/div[1]/table[1]") %>%
  html_table()
```

* Step 2: Write a function 

I highly recommend writing your function working slowly by wrapping the function with [`slowly()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/insistently.html).

```{r}
get_table_from_wiki <- function(url){
  
  download.file(url, destfile = "scraped_page.html", quiet = TRUE)

  target <- read_html("scraped_page.html")
  
  table <- target %>%
    html_nodes(xpath = "/html/body/div[3]/div[3]/div[5]/div[1]/table[1]") %>%
    html_table() 
  
  return(table)
}
```

* Step 3: Test

```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_table_from_wiki(url_list[[2]])
```

* Step 4: Automation 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map(url_list, get_table_from_wiki)
```

* Step 5: Error handling 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
map(url_lists, safely(get_table_from_wiki)) %>%
  map("result") %>% 
  # = map(function(x) x[["result"]]) = map(~.x[["name"]])
  purrr::compact() # Remove empty elements
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# If error occurred, "The URL is broken." will be stored in that element(s).
out <- map(
  url_list,
  possibly(get_table_from_wiki,
    otherwise = "The URL is broken."
  )
)
```

## XML/JSON: government database/social media scraping

### Governemnt database (XML) 

The following tax return data example comes from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Amazon database. [This PDf file](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990.pdf) shows what the original document looks like.

**Workflow**

1. Get the XML link and parse it
2. Go to the root of the XML document 
3. Identify a specific node you care about 
4. Get values related to that node 

![XML DOM (Document Object Model). Source: https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/nodetree.gif)

Step1: Get an XML document link

```{r}
xml_link <- c("http://s3.amazonaws.com/irs-form-990/201910919349301206_public.xml")
```

Step 2: Get the page and parse the XML document. 

```{r}
xml_root <- xml_link %>%
  # Get page and parse xml 
  xmlTreeParse() %>%
  # Get root
  xmlRoot()

# Data output: list 
typeof(xml_root) 

# Two elements. Our target is the second one.
summary(xml_root)
```

Step 3: Get nodes 

We grab the mission statement of this org from its tax report (990). `//` is an [XPath syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp) that helps to "select nodes in the document from the current node that matches the selection no matter where they are."

```{r}
xml_root %>%
  purrr::pluck(2) %>% # Second element (Return Data)
  getNodeSet("//MissionDesc") # Mission statement 
```

Step 4: Get values 

```{r}
xml_root %>%
  purrr::pluck(2) %>% # Second element (Return Data)
  getNodeSet("//MissionDesc") %>% # Mission statement 
  xmlValue()
```

### Social media API (JSON)

#### Objectives

-   Learning what kind of social media data are accessible through application programming interfaces (APIs)

**Review question**

In the previous session, we learned the difference between semi-structured data and structured data. Can anyone tell us the difference between them?

#### The big picture for digital data collection

1.  Input: semi-structured data

2.  Output: structured data

3.  Process:

    -   Getting **target data** from a remote server

        -   The target data is usually massive (\>10 G.B.) by the traditional social science standard.

    -   Parsing the target data your laptop/database

        -   Laptop (sample-parse): Downsamle the large target data and parse it on your laptop. This is just one option to [deal with big data in R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2019/07/17/3-big-data-strategies-for-r/). It's a simple strategy that doesn't require storing target data in your database.

    -   Database (push-parse): Push the large target data to a database, then explore, select, and filter it. If you are interested in using this option, check out my [SQL for R Users](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/sql-for-r-users) workshop.

![Sample-Parse. From RStudio.](https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2019-07-01-3-big-data-paradigms-for-r_files/sample_model.png)

![Push-Parse. From RStudio.](https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2019-07-01-3-big-data-paradigms-for-r_files/push_data.png)

-   But what exactly is this target data?

    -   When you scrape websites, you mostly deal with HTML (defines a structure of a website), CSS (its style), and JavaScript (its dynamic interactions).

    -   When you access social media data through API, you deal with either XML or JSON (major formats for storing and transporting data; they are light and flexible).

    -   XML and JSON have tree-like (nested; a root and branches) structures and keys and values (or elements and attributes).

    -   If HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are storefronts, then XML and JSON are warehouses.

#### Opportunities and challenges for parsing social media data

This explanation draws on Pablo Barbara's [LSE social media workshop slides](http://pablobarbera.com/social-media-workshop/social-media-slides.pdf).

**Basic information**

-   What is an API?: An interface (you can think of it as something akin to a restaurant menu. API parameters are API menu items.)

    -   [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (Representational state transfer) API: static information (e.g., user profiles, list of followers and friends)

    -   [Streaming](https://blog.axway.com/amplify/api-management/streaming-apis#:~:text=Streaming%20APIs%20are%20used%20to,a%20subset%20of%20Streaming%20APIS.) API: dynamic information (e.g, new tweets)

**Why should we care?** 

- API is the new data frontier. [ProgrammableWeb](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) shows that there are more than 24,046 APIs as of April 1, 2021.

  - Big and streaming (real-time) data 
  
  - High-dimensional data (e.g., text, image, video, etc.)
  
  - Lots of analytic opportunities (e.g., time-series, network, spatial analysis)
  
- Also, this type of data has many limitations (external validity, algorithmic bias, etc).

- Think about taking the API + approach (i.e., API not replacing but augmenting traditional data collection)

**How API works** 

Request (you form a request URL) <-> Response (API responses to your request by sending you data usually in JSON format)

![](https://mk0appinventiv4394ey.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2018/05/What-are-APIs-Learn-How-API-Works.jpg)

**API Statuses**

1. Twitter 

-   Twitter API is still widely accessible ([v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access) 


  - In January 2021, Twitter introduced the [academic Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research) that allows generous access to Twitter's historical data for academic researchers 

    - Many R packages exist for the Twitter API: [rtweet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/rtweet.pdf) (REST + streaming), [tweetscores](https://github.com/pablobarbera/twitter_ideology/tree/master/pkg/tweetscores) (REST), [streamR](https://github.com/pablobarbera/streamR) (streaming)

    - Some notable limitations. If Twitter users don't share their tweets' locations (e.g., GPS), you can't collect them. 
    
> Twitter data is unique from data shared by most other social platforms because it reflects information that users *choose* to share publicly. Our API platform provides broad access to public Twitter data that users have chosen to share with the world. - Twitter Help Center

-   What does this policy mean? If Twitter users don't share their tweets' locations (e.g., GPS), you can't collect them. However, you can get around this problem to identify a user's location based on their self-reported profile. 

2. Other APIs

The following comments draw on Alexandra Siegel's talk on "Collecting and Analyzing Social Media Data" given at Montréal Methods Workshops. 

- [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/) access has become constrained since the 2016 U.S. election.  

  - Exception: [Social Science One](https://socialscience.one/blog/unprecedented-facebook-urls-dataset-now-available-research-through-social-science-one).

  - Also, check out [Crowdtangle](https://www.crowdtangle.com/) for collecting public FB page data 
  
  - Using FB ads is still a popular method, especially among scholars studying developing countries. 
  
- [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3): generous access + (computer-generated) transcript in many languages 

  - Documentation on [captions](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/captions) from YouTube
  
- [Instragram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/): Data from public accounts are available. 

- [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/): Well-annotated text data suitable for machine learning 

**Upside**

-   Legal and well-documented.

Web scraping (Wild Wild West) \<\> API (Big Gated Garden)

-   You have legal but limited access to (growing) big data that can be divided into text, image, and video and transformed into cross-sectional (geocodes), longitudinal (timestamps), and historical event data (hashtags). See Zachary C. Steinert-Threlkeld's [2020 APSA Short Course Generating Event Data From Social Media](https://github.com/ZacharyST/APSA2020_EventDataFromSocialMedia).

-   Social media data are also well-organized, managed, and curated data. It's easy to navigate because XML and JSON have keys and values. If you find keys, you will find observations you look for.

**Downside**

1.  Rate-limited.

2.  If you want to access more and various data than those available, you need to pay for premium access.

### Next steps

We will learn how to access and collect data using Twitter and New York Times API. We are going to learn this in two ways: (1) using plug-and-play packages (both using RStudio and the terminal) and (2) getting API data from scratch (`httr,` `jsonlite`).

First, sign up for the Twitter developer account before everything else. If you want to know how to sign up for a new Twitter developer account and access Twitter API, see Steinert-Threlkeld's [APSA workshop slides](https://github.com/ZacharyST/APSA2020_EventDataFromSocialMedia/blob/master/Presentation/02_AccessTwitter.pdf).


### rtweet 

The `rtweet` examples come from [Chris Bail's tutorial](https://cbail.github.io/SICSS_APIs_markdown.html). 

#### Setup 

The first thing you need to do is set up.

Assuming that you already signed up for a Twitter developer account 

```{r eval = FALSE}
app_name <- "YOUR APP NAME"
consumer_key <- "YOUR CONSUMER KEY"
consumer_secret <- "YOUR CONSUMER SECRET"

rtweet::create_token(app = app_name, 
                     consumer_key = consumer_key, 
                     consumer_secret = consumer_secret)
```

#### Search API

Using **search API**; This API returns a collection of Tweets mentioning a particular query.

```{r}
# Install and load rtweet 
if (!require(pacman)) {install.packages("pacman")}
pacman::p_load(rtweet)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# The past 6-9 days 
rt <- search_tweets(q = "#stopasianhate", n = 1000, include_rts = FALSE)

# The longer term 
# search_fullarchive() premium service

head(rt$text)
```

Can you guess what would be the class type of rt?

```{r eval = FALSE}
class(rt)
```

What would be the number of rows?

```{r eval = FALSE}
nrow(rt)
```

#### Time series analysis 

- Time series analysis 

```{r eval = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, ggthemes, rtweet)

ts_plot(rt, "3 hours") +
  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Tweets about StopAsianHate from the Past Day",
       subtitle = "Tweet counts aggregated using three-hour intervals",
       source = "Twitter's Search API via rtweet")
```

#### Geographical analysis

- Geographical analysis

```{r eval = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(maps)

geocoded <- lat_lng(rt)

maps::map("state", lwd = .25) # lwd = line type 
with(geocoded, points(lng, lat))
```

### Hydrating

#### Objectives

-   Learning how hydrating works
-   Learning how to use [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) to communicate with Twitter's API

**Review question**

What are the main two types of Twitter's API?

#### Hydrating: An Alternative Way to Collect Historical Twitter Data

-   You can collect Twitter data using Twitter's API, or you can hydrate Tweet IDs collected by other researchers. This is an excellent resource to collect historical Twitter data.

-   [Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset for scientific use](http://www.panacealab.org/covid19/) by Panacealab

-   [Women's March Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/5ZVMOR) by Littman and Park

-   Harvard Dataverse has many dehydrated Tweet IDs that could be of interest to social scientists.

![Dehydrated Tweet IDs](https://github.com/jaeyk/digital_data_collection_workshop/raw/master/misc/dehydrated_tweets.png)

#### Twarc: one solution to (almost) all Twitter's API problems

-   Why Twarc?

    -   A command-line tool and Python library that works for almost every Twitter API-related problem.

    -   It's really well-documented, tested, and maintained.

        -   [Twarc documentation](https://scholarslab.github.io/learn-twarc/06-twarc-command-basics) covers basic commands.
        -   [Tward-cloud documentation](https://twarc-cloud.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/stable/pdf/) explains how to collect data from Twitter's API using Twarc running in [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS).

    -   Twarc was developed as part of the [Documenting the Now](https://www.docnow.io/) project, which the Mellon Foundation funded.

![One ring that rules them all.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lotr/images/8/8b/DOiAi2WUEAE3A1Y.0.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/699?cb=20200305221819)

-   There's no reason to be afraid of using a command-line tool and Python library, even though you primarily use R. It's easy to embed [Python code](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#python) and [shell scripts](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#shell-scripts) in R Markdown.

-   Even though you don't know how to write Python code or shell scripts, it's handy to learn how to integrate them into your R workflow.

-   I assume that you have already installed [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/).

```{bash eval = FALSE}
pip3 install twarc
```

##### Applications

The following examples are created by [the University of Virginia library](http://digitalcollecting.lib.virginia.edu/toolkit/docs/social-media/twarc-commands/).

###### Search

-   Download pre-existing tweets (7-day window) matching certain conditions

-   In command-line, `>` = Create a file

-   I recommend running the following commands in the terminal because it's more stable than in R Markdown.

![You can type commands in the Terminal in R Studio.](https://github.com/jaeyk/digital_data_collection_workshop/raw/master/misc/terminal.png)

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Key word 
twarc search blacklivesmatter > blm_tweets.jsonl
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Hashtag 
twarc search '#blacklivesmatter' > blm_tweets_hash.jsonl
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Hashtag + Language 
twarc search '#blacklivesmatter' --lang en > blm_tweets_hash.jsonl
```

-   It is really important to **save these tweets into a `jsonl` format;** `jsonl` extension refers to JSON **Lines** files. This structure is useful for splitting JSON data into smaller chunks if it is too large.

###### Filter

-   Download tweets meeting certain conditions as they happen.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Key word
twarc filter blacklivesmatter > blm_tweets.jsonl
```

###### Sample

-   Use Twitter's random sample of recent tweets.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
twarc sample > tweets.jsonl 
```

###### Hydrate

-   Tweet I.D.s -\> Tweets

```{bash eval=FALSE}
twarc hydrate tweet_ids.txt > tweets.jsonl 
```

###### Dehydrate

-   Hydrate \<\> Dehydrate
-   Tweets -\> Tweet I.D.s

```{bash eval=FALSE}
twarc dehydrate tweets.jsonl > tweet_ids.txt
```

**Challenge**

1.  Collect tweets containing keywords of your choice using `twarc search` and save them as `tweets.jsonl`.

2.  Using `less` command in the terminal, inspect `twarc.log.`

3.  Using `less` command in the terminal, inspect `tweets.json.`

### Parsing JSON

#### Objectives

-   Learning chunk and pull strategy
-   Learning how `tidyjson` works
-   Learning how to apply `tidyjson` to tweets

#### Chunk and Pull

##### Problem

-   What if the size of the Twitter data you downloaded is too big (e.g., \>10 GB) to do complex wrangling in R?

##### Solution

![Chunk and Pull. From Studio.](https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2019-07-01-3-big-data-paradigms-for-r_files/chunk_pull.png)

Step1: Split the large JSON file in small chunks.

```{bash eval = FALSE}
#Divide the JSON file by 100 lines (tweets)

# Linux and Windows (in Bash)
$ split -100 search.jsonl

# macOS
$ gsplit -100 search.jsonl
```

-   After that, you will see several files appear in the directory. Each of these files should have 100 tweets or fewer. All of these file names **should start with "x," as in "xaa."**

Step 2: Apply the parsing function to each chunk and pull all of these chunks together.

```{r eval = FALSE}

# You need to choose a Tweet JSON file
filepath <- file.choose()

# Assign the parsed result to the `df` object
# 11.28 sec elapsed to parse 17,928 tweets 
tic()
df <- jsonl_to_df(filepath)
toc()

```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Setup 
n_cores <- availableCores() - 1

n_cores # This number depends on your computer spec.

plan(multiprocess, # multicore, if supported, otherwise multisession
     workers = n_cores) # the maximum number of workers

# You need to designate a directory path where you saved the list of JSON files.

# 9.385 sec elapsed to parse 17,928 tweets 

dirpath <- tcltk::tk_choose.dir()

tic()
df_all <- tidytweetjson::jsonl_to_df_all(dirpath)
toc()

```

##### tidyjson

The [`tidyjson`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyjson/vignettes/introduction-to-tidyjson.html) package helps to use tidyverse framework to JSON data.

-   toy example

```{r}

# JSON collection; nested structure + keys and values 
worldbank[1]

# Check out keys (objects)
worldbank %>% 
  as.tbl_json() %>%
  gather_object() %>%
  filter(document.id == 1)

```

```{r}
  
# Get the values associated with the keys 
worldbank %>% 
  as.tbl_json() %>% # Turn JSON into tbl_json object 
  enter_object("project_name") %>% # Enter the objects 
  append_values_string() %>% # Append the values 
  as_tibble() # To reduce the size of the file 

```

-   The following example draws on my [tidytweetjson](https://github.com/jaeyk/tidytweetjson) R package. The package applies `tidyjson` to Tweets.

###### Individual file

```{r}

jsonl_to_df <- function(file_path){

# Save file name 

file_name <- strsplit(x = file_path, 
                     split = "[/]") 

file_name <- file_name[[1]][length(file_name[[1]])]

# Import a Tweet JSON file

listed <- read_json(file_path, format = c("jsonl"))

# IDs of the tweets with country codes

ccodes <- listed %>%
  enter_object("place") %>%
  enter_object("country_code") %>%
  append_values_string() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename("country_code" = "string")

# IDs of the tweets with location

locations <- listed %>%
  enter_object("user") %>%
  enter_object("location") %>%
  append_values_string() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(location = "string")

# Extract other key elements from the JSON file

df <- listed %>%
  spread_values(
    id = jnumber("id"),
    created_at = jstring("created_at"),
    full_text = jstring("full_text"),
    retweet_count = jnumber("retweet_count"),
    favorite_count = jnumber("favorite_count"),
    user.followers_count = jnumber("user.followers_count"),
    user.friends_count = jnumber("user.friends_count")
  ) %>%
	  as_tibble

message(paste("Parsing", file_name, "done."))

# Full join
outcome <- full_join(ccodes, df) %>% full_join(locations)

# Or you can write this way: outcome <- reduce(list(df, ccodes, locations), full_join)

# Select
outcome %>% select(-c("document.id"))}

```

###### Many files

-   Set up parallel processing.

```{r eval = FALSE}

n_cores <- availableCores() - 1

n_cores # This number depends on your computer spec.

plan(multiprocess, # multicore, if supported, otherwise multisession
     workers = n_cores) # the maximum number of workers

**Review**

There are, at least, three ways you can use function + `purrr::map().`

```{r eval = FALSE}

squared <- function(x){
  x*2 
}

# Named function 
map(1:3, squared)

# Anonymous function 
map(1:3, function(x){ x *2 })

# Using formula; ~ = formula, .x = input 
map(1:3,~.x*2)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Create a list of file paths 
filename <- list.files(dir_path,
          pattern = '^x',
          full.names = TRUE)

df <- filename %>%

# Apply jsonl_to_df function to items on the list
future_map(~jsonl_to_df(.)) %>%

# Full join the list of dataframes
reduce(full_join,
       by = c("id",
              "location",
              "country_code",
              "created_at",
              "full_text",
              "retweet_count",
              "favorite_count",
              "user.followers_count",
              "user.friends_count"))

# Output
df
```

- The main difference is using RStudio vs. the terminal. 

- The difference matters when your data size is large. For example, suppose the size of the Twitter data you downloaded is 10 GB. R/RStudio might have a hard time dealing with this size of data. Then, how can you wrangle this data size in a complex way using R?

### Getting API data from scratch 

Load packages. For the connection interface, don't use `RCurl,` but I strongly recommend using `httr.` The following code examples draw from my R interface for the New York Times API called [`rnytapi`](https://jaeyk.github.io/rnytapi/).

```{r eval = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(httr, jsonlite, purrr, glue)
```

#### Form REQUEST 

```{r eval = FALSE}
get_request <- function(term, begin_date, end_date, key, page = 1) {

    out <- GET("http://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json",
        query = list('q' = term,
                     'begin_date' = begin_date,
                     'end_date' = end_date,
                     'api-key' = key,
                     'page' = page))

    return(out)

}
```

#### Extract data 

```{r eval = FALSE}
get_content <- function(term, begin_date, end_date, key, page = 1) {

    message(glue("Scraping page {page}"))

    fromJSON(content(get_request(term, begin_date, end_date, key, page),
                     "text",
                encoding = "UTF-8"),
                simplifyDataFrame = TRUE, flatten = TRUE) %>% as.data.frame()

}
```

#### Automating iterations 

```{r eval = FALSE}
extract_all <- function(term, begin_date, end_date, key) {

    request <- GET("http://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json",
                   query = list('q' = term,
                                'begin_date' = begin_date,
                                'end_date' = end_date,
                                'api-key' = key))

    max_pages <- (round(content(request)$response$meta$hits[1] / 10) - 1)

    message(glue("The total number of pages is {max_pages}"))

    iter <- 0:max_pages

    arg_list <- list(rep(term, times = length(iter)),
                     rep(begin_date, times = length(iter)),
                     rep(end_date, times = length(iter)),
                     rep(key, times = length(iter)),
                     iter
                     )

    out <- pmap_dfr(arg_list, slowly(get_content,
                                     # 6 seconds sleep is the default requirement.
                                     rate = rate_delay(
                                         pause = 6,
                                         max_times = 4000)))

    return(out)

    }
```
