This chapter helps you to step up your R skills with functional programming. The `purrr` package provides easy-to-use tools to automate repeated things in your entire R workflow (e.g., wrangling, modeling, and visualization). The result is cleaner, faster, more readable, and extendable code.

```

## Flow control {#flow}

* Control structures = putting logic in code to control flow (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `repeat`, `break`, `next`)

* Almost all the conditional operators used in Python also work in R. The basic loop setup is also very similar, with some small syntax adjustments. 

* ```if()``` is a function whose arguments must be specified inside parentheses.

* ```else```, however, is a reserved operator that takes no arguments. Note that there is no ```elif``` option --- one simply writes ```else if()```.  

* Whereas operations to be executed after conditional evaluations in Python come after a ```:```, R operations must only be enclosed in curly brackets: ```{}```.  Furthermore, there is no requirement for indentation. 

### if (one condition) 

```{r}
x <- 5

if (x < 0) { # Condition 
  print("x is negative") # Do something 
}
```


```{r}
x <- -5

if (x < 0) {
  print("x is negative")
}
```

### if + else (two conditions)

```{r}
x <- 5

if (x < 0) {
  print("x is negative")
} else{
  print("x is positive")
}
```

### if + else if + else (three conditions)

```{r}
x <- 0

if (x < 0) { # Condition 
  print("x is negative") # Do something 

  } else if (x == 0) { 
  
    print("x is zero") # Do something else 

    } else {print("x is positive") # Do something else 

      }

```

- In general, it's not a good idea to write nested code (lots of `else_if()` or `ifelse()`). It is not easy to read, debug, modulize, and extend. 
- Instead, write functions and, if necessary, use `if()` only. We'll come back to this later.

### Functions 

While functions are defined in Python using the ```def``` reserved operator, R sees functions as just another type of named object.  Thus, they require explicit assignment to an object.  This is done using the function ```function()```, which creates a function taking the arguments specified in parentheses.  

function = input + computation (begin -> end) + output 

```{r}
simple.function <- function(x){
  print(x + 1)
}

simple.function(x = 2)

less.simple.function <- function(x, y){
  print(x - y + 1)
}

less.simple.function(x = 2, y = 10)
```

Concerning returning function output, most of the same rules apply as with Python. Be sure to remember that ```return()``` will only process a single object, so multiple items must usually be returned as a list. Note that your ordering of the functions matters, too. 

```{r}
dumbfun <- function(x){
  return(x)
  print("This will never print :(")
}

dumbfun(x = "something")

dumbfun <- function(x){
  print("Why did I print?")
  return(x)
}

dumbfun(x = "something")

dumbfun <- function(x,y){
  thing1 <- x
  thing2 <- y
  return(list(thing1, thing2))
}

dumbfun(x = "some text", y = "some data")
dumbfun(x = c(5,10,15), y = "some data")
```

R functions also allow you to set default argument values:

```{r}
less.simple.function <- function(x, y = 0){
  print(x - y + 1)
}

less.simple.function(x = 2)

less.simple.function(x = 2, y = 10)
```

Concerning specifying arguments, one can either use argument **position** specifications (i.e., the order) or argument **name** specifications.  The latter is strongly preferred, as it is straightforward to specify incorrect argument values accidentally.

```{r}
send <- function(message, recipient, cc=NULL, bcc=NULL){
  print(paste(message, recipient, sep = ", "))
  print(paste("CC:", cc, sep = " "))
  print(paste("BCC:", bcc, sep = " "))
}

send(message = "Hello", recipient = "World", cc = "Sun", bcc = "Jane")

send("Hello", "World", "Sun", "Jane")

send("Hello", "Sun", "Jane", "World")

send(message = "Hello", cc = "Sun", bcc = c("Jane", "Rochelle"), recipient = "World")
```

Also, note that functions don't have what CS people called side-effects. Functions only define local variables = They don't change objects stored in the global environment. (Consider the difference between `<-` and `=` for assignments.) That's why you can use functions for reusable tasks since it does not interrupt other essential things in your system.

See [the following example](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2011/11/23/lexical-scope-and-function-closures-in-r/) from Wilkinson.

```{r}
a = 1 
b = 2

f <- function(x)
{
  a*x + b
}

f(2)

g <- function(x)
{
  a = 2
  b = 1
  f(x)
}

g(2) # a equals still 1 
```

**Additional tips**

* Nonstandard evaluation 

Nonstandard evaluation is an advanced subject. If you feel overwhelmed, you are more than welcome to skip this. But if you are serious about R programming, this is something you want to check out. For a deeper understanding of this issue, I recommend reading [Ren Kun's very informative blog post](https://renkun.me/2014/12/03/tips-on-non-standard-evaluation-in-r/) carefully. 

This part draws on one of the [the dplyr package articles](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html.

In tidyverse, calling a variable with or without quotation mark (string or not) makes little difference because tidyeval is a non-standard evaluation. This flexibility runs into the following problem when it comes to programming. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Using `mpg` instead of `mtcars$mpg` is called data masking.

mtcars %>% select(mpg)

mtcars %>% select("mpg")

```

Data and env-variables 

```{r}
# df = environment variable 
df <- data.frame(
  x = c(1:5),
  y = c(6:10)
  )

# x, y = data variables 
df$x
df$y
```

- Problem 

```{r}
x <- NULL 

var_summary <- function(env_var, data_var){
 
   env_var %>%
    summarise(mean = mean(data_var))

}

```

You may expect that the output is mean = 2.5 ... but 

It's because the mean() function doesn't take `df$x` for data_var but `x`. It would be best if you linked x with the environment variable.

```{r}

var_summary(df, x)

```

This is how you can fix this. 


```{r}

# Solution
vs_fix <- function(env_var, data_var){
 
   env_var %>%
    summarise(mean = mean({{data_var}}))

}

# You can also do this. 
vs_fix_enhanced <- function(env_var, data_var){
 
   env_var %>%
    summarise("mean_{{data_var}}" := mean({{data_var}})) # If you use the glue package, this syntax is very intuitive.

}

vs_fix_enhanced(df, x)

```

If you have a character vector input ... 

```{r}
mtcars_count <- mtcars %>%
  names() %>%
  purrr::map(~count(mtcars, .data[[.x]])) # We're going to learn about map in the rest of this session.

mtcars_count[[1]]
```


### for loop 

![Concept map for a for loop. Source: https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:memory-concept-maps](https://teachtogether.tech/en/figures/for-loop.svg)

Loops in R also work the same way as in Python, with just a few adjustments.  First, recall that index positions in R start at 1.  Second, ```while()``` and ```for()``` are functions rather than reserved operators, meaning they must take arguments in parentheses.  Third, just like ```else```, the ```in``` operator *is* reserved and takes no arguments in parentheses.  Fourth, the conditional execution must appear between curly brackets.  Finally, indentation is meaningless, but each new operation must appear on a new line.

- `while()`: when we have no idea how many times loop needs to be executed.
- `for()`: when we know how many times loop needs to be executed. This is likely to be the loop you are going to use most frequently. 

```{r}
fruits <- c("apples", "oranges", "pears", "bananas")

# a while loop
i <- 1
while (i <= length(fruits)) {
  print(fruits[i])
  i <- i + 1
}

# a for loop
for (i in 1:length(fruits)) {
  print(fruits[i])
}
```

### apply family 

While and for loops in R can be very slow. For this reason, R has many built-in iteration methods to speed up execution times. In many cases, packages will have "behind-the-scenes" ways to avoid `for loops`, but what if you need to write your function? 

A common method of getting around for loops is the **apply** family of functions. These take a data structure and a function and apply a function over all the object elements.

```{r}
fruit <- c("apple", "orange", "pear", "banana")

# make function that takes in only one element
make.plural <- function(x){
   plural <- paste(x, 's', sep = '') # sep is for collapse, so collpase ''
   return(plural)
}

make.plural('apple')

```

* `apply()` : loop over the margins (1 = row, 2 = column) of an array 
* `lapply()` : loop over a list then returns a list 
* `sapply()` : loop over a list then returns a named vector 
* `tapply()`: loop over subsets of a vector 
* `mapply()`: multivariate version of `lapply()`. Use this if you have a function that takes in 2 or more arguments.


```{r}
# apply that function to every element
lapply(fruit, make.plural) # returns a list
sapply(fruit, make.plural) # returns a named vector

library(purrr) # load package
map(fruit, make.plural) # type consistent
```

```{r}
# Why sapply is bad 

sapply(1:100, paste) # return character 

sapply(integer(), paste) # return list!

library(purrr)
map(1:100, paste) # return list

map(integer(), paste) # return list
```

## purrr {#purrr}

### Why map? 

#### Objectives 

- How to use `purrr` to automate workflow in a cleaner, faster, and more extendable way

#### Copy-and-paste programming 

> Copy-and-paste programming, sometimes referred to as just pasting, is the production of highly repetitive computer programming code, as produced by copy and paste operations. It is primarily a pejorative term; those who use the term are often implying a lack of programming competence. It may also be the result of technology limitations (e.g., an insufficiently expressive development environment) as subroutines or libraries would normally be used instead. However, there are occasions when copy-and-paste programming is considered acceptable or necessary, such as for boilerplate, loop unrolling (when not supported automatically by the compiler), or certain programming idioms, and it is supported by some source code editors in the form of snippets. - Wikipedia 

- The following exercise was inspired by [Wickham's example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html).

- Let's imagine `df` is a survey dataset. 

    - `a, b, c, d` = Survey questions 

    - `-99`: non-responses 
    
    - Your goal: replace `-99` with `NA` 
    
```{r}

# Data

set.seed(1234) # for reproducibility

df <- tibble(
  "a" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5, replace = TRUE),
  "b" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5, replace = TRUE),
  "c" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5, replace = TRUE),
  "d" = sample(c(-99, 1:3), size = 5, replace = TRUE)
)
```

```{r}

# Copy and paste
df$a[df$a == -99] <- NA
df$b[df$b == -99] <- NA
df$c[df$c == -99] <- NA
df$d[df$d == -99] <- NA

df
```

- **Challenge**. Explain why this solution is not very efficient (Hint: If `df$a[df$a == -99] <- NA` has an error, how will you fix it? A solution is not scalable if it's not automatable.

#### Using a function 

- Let's recall what's function in R: `input + computation + output` 

- If you write a function, you gain efficiency because you don't need to copy and paste the computation part. 

`
function(input){
  
  computation 
  
  return(output)
}
`

```{r}

# Function

fix_missing <- function(x) {
  x[x == -99] <- NA
  x
}

# Apply function to each column (vector)

df$a <- fix_missing(df$a)
df$b <- fix_missing(df$b)
df$c <- fix_missing(df$c)
df$d <- fix_missing(df$d)

df

```

- **Challenge** Why is using function more efficient than 100% copying and pasting? Can you think about a way we can automate the process?

- Many options for automation in R: `for loop`, `apply` family, etc. 

- Here's a tidy solution that comes from the `purrr` package.

- The power and joy of one-liner. 

```{r}

df <- purrr::map_df(df, fix_missing)

df
```

`map()` is a [higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)) that applies a given function to each element of a list/vector. 

![This is how map() works. It's easier to understand with a picture.](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f0494d020aa517ae7b1011cea4c4a9f21702df8b/2577b/diagrams/functionals/map.png)

    - Input: Takes a vector/list. 
    
    - Computation: Calls the function once for each element of the vector 
  
    - Output: Returns in a list or whatever data format you prefer (e.g., `_df helper: dataframe`)

- **Challenge** If you run the code below, what will be the data type of the output?

```{r}

map(df, fix_missing)

```

- Why `map()` is a good alternative to `for loop`.

<p>The Joy of Functional Programming (for Data Science) - Hadley Wickham</p>
```

```{r}

# Built-in data
data("airquality")

tic()

# Placeholder
out1 <- vector("double", ncol(airquality))

# Sequence variable
for (i in seq_along(airquality)) { 

  # Assign an iteration result to each element of the placeholder list 
  out1[[i]] <- mean(airquality[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
}

toc()
```

`map` is faster because it applies function to the items on the list/vector in parallel. Also, using `map_dbl` reduces an extra step you need to take. Hint: `map_dbl(x, mean, na.rm = TRUE)` = `vapply(x, mean, na.rm = TRUE, FUN.VALUE = double(1))`
 

```{r}

tic()
out1 <- airquality %>% map_dbl(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
toc()
```

- In short, `map()` is more readable, faster, and easily extendable with other data science tasks (e.g., wrangling, modeling, and visualization) using `%>%`. 

- Final point: Why not base R `apply` family? 

- Short answer: `purrr::map()` is simpler to write. 

**Additional tips**

Performance testing (profiling) is an important part of programming. `tictoc()` measures the time needed to run a target function for once. If you want a more robust measure of timing as well as information on memory (**speed** and **space** both matter for performance testing), consider using the [`bench` package](https://github.com/r-lib/bench) that is designed for high precision timing of R expressions. 


```{r}
map_mark <- bench::mark(

  out1 <- airquality %>% map_dbl(mean, na.rm = TRUE)

  )

map_mark
```

#### Applications 

1. Many models

- One popular application of `map()` is to run regression models (or whatever model you want to run) on list-columns. No more copying and pasting for running many regression models on subgroups!

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Have you ever tried this?
lm_A <- lm(y ~ x, subset(data, subgroup == "group_A"))
lm_B <- lm(y ~ x, subset(data, subgroup == "group_B"))
lm_C <- lm(y ~ x, subset(data, subgroup == "group_C"))
lm_D <- lm(y ~ x, subset(data, subgroup == "group_D"))
lm_E <- lm(y ~ x, subset(data, subgroup == "group_E"))
```

- For more information on this technique, read the Many Models subchapter of the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html#creating-list-columns).

```{r}
# Function
lm_model <- function(df) {
  lm(Temp ~ Ozone, data = df)
}

# Map
models <- airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  nest() %>% # Create list-columns
  mutate(ols = map(data, lm_model)) # Map
models$ols[1]

# Add tidying
tidy_lm_model <- purrr::compose( # compose multiple functions
  broom::tidy, # convert lm objects into tidy tibbles
  lm_model
)

tidied_models <- airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  nest() %>% # Create list-columns
  mutate(ols = map(data, tidy_lm_model))

tidied_models$ols[1]
```

2. Simulations 

A good friend of `map()` function is `rerun()` function. This combination is really useful for simulations. Consider the following example. 

* Base R approach 

```{r}

set.seed(1234)

small_n <- 100 ; k <- 1000 ; mu <- 500 ; sigma <- 20 

y_list <- rep(list(NA), k)

for (i in seq(k)) {
        
    y_list[[i]] <- rnorm(small_n, mu, sigma)
        
}

y_means <- unlist(lapply(y_list, mean))

qplot(y_means) +
   geom_vline(xintercept = 500, linetype = "dotted", color = "red")
```

* rerun() + map()

```{r}

small_n <- 100 ; k <- 1000; mu <- 500 ; sigma <- 20 

y_tidy <- rerun(k, rnorm(small_n, mu, sigma)) 

y_means_tidy <- map_dbl(y_tidy, mean)

# Visualize 
(qplot(y_means) +
   geom_vline(xintercept = 500, linetype = "dotted", color = "red")) +
(qplot(y_means_tidy) +
   geom_vline(xintercept = 500, linetype = "dotted", color = "red"))
```

## Automote 2 or 2+ tasks {#map2}

### Objectives 

- Learning how to use `map2()` and `pmap()` to avoid writing nested loops.

### Problem 

- Problem: How can you create something like the below?

[1] "University =  Berkeley | Department =  waterbenders"

[1] "University =  Berkeley | Department =  earthbenders"

[1] "University =  Berkeley | Department =  firebenders"

[1] "University =  Berkeley | Department =  airbenders"

[1] "University =  Stanford | Department =  waterbenders"

[1] "University =  Stanford | Department =  earthbenders"

[1] "University =  Stanford | Department =  firebenders"

[1] "University =  Stanford | Department =  airbenders"

- The most manual way: You can copy and paste eight times.

```{r}
paste("University = Berkeley | Department = CS")
```

### For loop 

- A slightly more efficient way: using a for loop. 
- Think about which part of the statement is constant and which part varies ( = parameters).  
- Do we need a placeholder? No. We don't need a placeholder because we don't store the result of iterations.
    
- **Challenge**: How many parameters do you need to solve the problem below?
  
```{r}

# Outer loop

for (univ in c("Berkeley", "Stanford")) {

  # Inner loop

  for (dept in c("waterbenders", "earthbenders", "firebenders", "airbenders")) {
    print(paste("University = ", univ, "|", "Department = ", dept))
  }
}
```

- This is not bad, but ... `n` arguments -> `n-nested for loops`. As a scale of your problem grows, your code gets complicated.

> To become significantly more reliable, code must become more transparent. In particular, nested conditions and loops must be viewed with great suspicion. Complicated control flows confuse programmers. Messy code often hides bugs. — [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup)

### map2 & pmap

- Step 1: Define inputs and a function.

- **Challenge** Why are we using `rep()` to create input vectors? For instance, for `univ_list` why not just use `c("Berkeley", "Stanford")`?

```{r}

# Inputs (remember the length of these inputs should be identical)

univ_list <- rep(c("Berkeley", "Stanford"), 4)
dept_list <- rep(c("waterbenders", "earthbenders", "firebenders", "airbenders"), 2)

# Function

print_lists <- function(univ, dept) {
  print(paste(
    "University = ", univ, "|",
    "Department = ", dept
  ))
}

# Test

print_lists(univ_list[1], dept_list[1])
```

- Step2: Using `map2()` or `pmap()`

![](https://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/images/map2.png)

```{r}
# 2 arguments
map2_output <- map2(univ_list, dept_list, print_lists)
```

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e426c5755e2e65bdcc073d387775db79791f32fd/92902/diagrams/functionals/pmap.png)

```{r}
# 3+ arguments
pmap_output <- pmap(list(univ_list, dept_list), print_lists)
```

- **Challenge** Have you noticed that we used a slightly different input for `pmap()` compared to `map()` or `map2()`? What is the difference?

## Automate plotting {#glue}

### Objective 

- Learning how to use `map()` and `glue()` to automate creating multiple plots

### Problem 

- Making the following data visualization process more efficient. 

```{r}

data("airquality")

airquality %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Ozone, y = Solar.R)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Ozone and Solar.R",
    y = "Solar.R"
  )

airquality %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Ozone, y = Wind)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Ozone and Wind",
    y = "Wind"
  )
airquality %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Ozone, y = Temp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Ozone and Temp",
    y = "Temp"
  )
```

### Solution 

- Learn how `glue()` works. 

- `glue()` combines strings and objects and it works simpler and faster than `paste()` or `sprintif()`. 

```{r}
names <- c("Jae", "Aniket", "Avery")

fields <- c("Political Science", "Law", "Public Health")

glue("{names} studies {fields}.")
```

- So, our next step is to combine `glue()` and `map()`. 

- Let's first think about writing a function that includes `glue()`.

- **Challenge**
How can you create the character vector of column names? 

- **Challenge**
How can you make `ggplot2()` take strings as x and y variable names? (Hint: Type `?aes_string()`) 

```{r}
airquality %>%
  ggplot(aes_string(x = names(airquality)[1], y = names(airquality)[2])) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = glue("Relationship between Ozone and {names(airquality)[2]}"),
    y = glue("{names(airquality)[2]}")
  )
```

- The next step is to write an automatic plotting function. 

    - Note that in the function argument `i` (abstract) replaced 2 (specific): abstraction  

```{r}
create_point_plot <- function(i) {
  airquality %>%
    ggplot(aes_string(x = names(airquality)[1], y = names(airquality)[i])) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(
      title = glue("Relationship between Ozone and {names(airquality)[i]}"),
      y = glue("{names(airquality)[i]}")
    )
}
```

- The final step is to put the function in `map()`.

```{r}
map(2:ncol(airquality), create_point_plot)
```

## Automate joining {#reduce}

### Objective 

- Learning how to use `reduce()` to automate row-binding multiple dataframes

### Problem 

- How can you make row-binding multiple dataframes more efficient?

```{r}
df1 <- tibble(
  x = sample(1:10, size = 3, replace = TRUE),
  y = sample(1:10, size = 3, replace = TRUE),
  z = sample(1:10, size = 3, replace = TRUE)
)

df2 <- tibble(
  x = sample(1:10, size = 3, replace = TRUE),
  y = sample(1:10, size = 3, replace = TRUE),
  z = sample(1:10, size = 3, replace = TRUE)
)

df3 <- tibble(
  x = sample(1:10, size = 3, replace = TRUE),
  y = sample(1:10, size = 3, replace = TRUE),
  z = sample(1:10, size = 3, replace = TRUE)
)
```

### Copy and paste

```{r}

first_bind <- bind_rows(df1, df2)

second_bind <- bind_rows(first_bind, df3)

    - Input: Takes a vector of length n
  
    - Computation: Calls a function with a pair of values at a time
  
    - Output: Returns a vector of length 1

## Make automation slower or faster {#speed}

```{r}
# Install packages 
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, # tidyverse pkgs including purrr
               tictoc, # performance test 
               furrr) # parallel processing  reproducibility 
```

### Objectives 

- Learning how to use `slowly()` and `future_` to make the automation process either slower or faster

### How to Make Automation Slower

- Scraping 50 pages from a website and you don't want to overload the server. How can you do that?

#### For loop 

```{r, include=FALSE}

for (i in 1:50) {
  
  message("Scraping page ",i)
  
  if ((i %% 10) == 0) {
    
    message("Break time")
    
    Sys.sleep(1) # 1 second 
  }
  
}

```

#### Map 

- `walk()` works the same as `map()` but doesn't store its output. 

```{r,include=FALSE}

walk(1:50, function(x){message("Scraping page", x)})

```

- If you're web scraping, one problem with this approach is it's too fast by human standards.

```{r}

tic("Scraping pages")
walk(1:10, function(x){message("Scraping page", x)}) # Anonymous function; I don't name the function 
toc(log = TRUE) # save toc 

```

- If you want to make the function run slowly ... 

> slowly() takes a function and modifies it to wait a given amount of time between each call. - `purrr` package vignette 

- If a function is a verb, then a helper function is an adverb (modifying the behavior of the verb). 

```{r,include=FALSE}

# 49.05 sec elapsed

tic("scraping pages with deplay", log = TRUE)

walk(1:10, slowly(function(x){message("Scraping page", x)},   
                    rate = rate_delay(pause = 1))) # pause = Delay between attempts in seconds

toc(log = TRUE)

tic.log(format = TRUE)

```

### How to Make Automation Faster 

In a different situation, you want to make your function run faster. This is a common situation when you collect and analyze data a large-scale. You can solve this problem using parallel processing. A modern processor has a multi-core. You can divide tasks among these cores. R uses a single thread or only core. You can configure this default setting by the following code. For further information on the parallel processing in R (there are many other options), read [this review](https://yxue-me.com/post/2019-05-12-a-glossary-of-parallel-computing-packages-in-r-2019/).

- Parallel processing setup 

    - Step1: Determine the number of max workers (`availableCores()`)
    
    - Step2: Determine the parallel processing mode (`plan()`) 

We do `availableCores() - 1` to save some processing power for other programs.

```{r}
# Setup 
n_cores <- availableCores() - 1
n_cores # This number depends on your computer spec.
```

```{r}
plan(multiprocess, # multicore, if supported, otherwise multisession
     workers = n_cores) # the maximum number of workers
```

**What's the difference between multisession and multicore?**

I skip technical explanations and only focus on their usages.

- multisession : fast, and relatively stable. It works across different OSs and also for RStudio.
- multicore :	faster, but unstable. It doesn't work for Windows/RStudio.

```{r include=FALSE}
plan(sequential)

tic("averaging 100000 without parallel processing", log = TRUE)
map100000 <- future_map(1:100000, mean)
toc(log = TRUE)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
plan(multiprocess, # multicore, if supported, otherwise multisession
     workers = n_cores) # the maximum number of workers

tic("averaging 100000 with parallel processing", log = TRUE)
map100000 <- future_map(1:100000, mean)
toc(log = TRUE)
```

```{r}
tic.log(format = TRUE)
```

Because of the overhead cost (e.g., time spent communicating data between processing), parallel processing does not always increase performance. Use this technique either when the computation part is heavy or when you need to repeat the process a large number of times.  

## Make error handling easier {#robustness}

### Learning objective 

- Learning how to use `safely()` and `possibly()` to make error handling easier 
### Problem 

- **Challenge**

- Explain why we can't run `map(url_list, read_html)`

```{r}

url_list <- c(
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University",
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University",
  "https://DLAB"
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map(url_list, read_html)
```

- This is a straightforward problem, so it's easy to tell where the problem is. How can you make your error more informative? 

### Solution 

#### Try-catch 

- There are three kinds of messages you will run into if your code has an error based on the following functions.  

    - `stop()`: errors; Functions must stop. 
    - `warning()`: warnings; Functions may still work. Nonetheless, something is possibly messed up. 
    - `message()`: messages; Some actions happened. 
    
- The basic logic of `try-catch`, R's basic error handling function, works like the following. 

```{r}
tryCatch(
  {
    map(url_list, read_html)
  },
  warning = function(w) {
    "Warning"
  },
  error = function(e) {
    "Error"
  },
  finally = {
    "Message"
  }
)
```

- Here's `purrr` version of the `try-catch` mechanism (evaluates code and assigns exception handlers). 

#### safely

**Outputs** 

- result: result or `NULL`
- error: `NULL` or `error` 

```{r}
map(url_list, safely(read_html))
```

- The easier way to solve this problem is just to avoid the error.

```{r}
map(url_list, safely(read_html)) %>%
  map("result") %>% 
  # = map(function(x) x[["result"]]) = map(~.x[["name"]])
  purrr::compact() # Remove empty elements
```

#### possibly 

What if the best way to solve the problem is not to ignore the error ... 

```{r}
# If error occurred, "The URL is broken." will be stored in that element(s).
out <- map(
  url_list,
  possibly(read_html,
    otherwise = "The URL is broken."
  )
)

# Let's find the broken URL.
url_list[out[seq(out)] == "The URL is broken."]
```
